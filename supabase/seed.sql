Bluesky Buy Now Development Blog: Happy Holidays! December 18, 2024 Hello vikings! It\\u2019s getting cold and snowy here in our northern part of the world, which is giving us plenty of inspiration for our work on the Deep North. Like we said last time, we\\u2019ve got everyone focused on the biome update now, but a lot of what we\\u2019ve got cooking we\\u2019d like to keep a bit secret so that you\\u2019ll get to properly experience it for the first time once you get to play. With that said though, we won\\u2019t be going completely dark either! This month we have snuck our teaser into a little Yule Card from the Deep North. Can you find the new build piece? The build piece you see here is of course not going to be the only new build piece in the Deep North either; there will be plenty of options for builders to choose from! Other than working away on the Deep North it\\u2019s been a pretty quiet month here at Iron Gate, so this is gonna be a fairly short blog post. Before we move on to the Build of the Month, we just wanted to give a headsup about our new Bluesky account , in case you missed it! If you use Bluesky, feel free to give us a follow there to stay updated as frequently as on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram. Build of the Month This month our attention was caught by not just a building, but by an entire town! Truly impressive work by PiotrGremlin ! If you want your creation to be featured in this section, use the hashtag #ValheimBotM on social media. Please also send us a DM with a link to your post, to make sure that we see it. You can view previous builds in this thread on Steam . May your fires warm you! /The Iron Gate team If you\\u2019d like to discuss the content of this post, please visit our Discord, or our forums on Reddit and Steam, or make a comment on social media!

\"Valheim: Development Blog: Lighting the Way - Valheim About News Media Press Support Facebook Wiki Discord Bluesky Buy Now Development Blog: Lighting the Way November 20, 2024 Hello again vikings! It\\u2019s been a while since the last blog post, as we chose to instead just simply post the patch notes for the Bog Witch update last month. Speaking of, we hope you\\u2019ve been enjoying the update! If you haven\\u2019t checked it out yet, you have some new food and drink, as well as a curious new merchant waiting for you. As per usual, we want to thank everyone who has played so far! We also hope you enjoyed watching The Spill in October! If you missed it, it was a livestream featuring a whole bunch of games from the Coffee Stain umbrella, with various hangouts and talks. You can watch the VOD on our YouTube channel , with the Valheim segments marked down for your convenience. During The Spill we of course talked a bit about the Bog Witch, but we also talked about the Deep North and Valheim\\u2019s road towards 1.0. As you may have known already, the Deep North will be the final biome update as well as the update that marks Valheim leaving Early Access. We\\u2019ve still got a ways to go yet before we\\u2019re ready for that, but we\\u2019re hoping to make it a proper 1.0 package with new things to discover in early biomes as well. With the Bog Witch update behind us (save for perhaps some bug fixing), we are now all hands on deck with the Deep North and 1.0, and we would like to finally begin to share some teasers of what\\u2019s to come! For example, we want to take a moment to gaze up at the night sky, and the aurora borealis that dance there: We will continue to share images from the development with you, but we also want to keep some things a surprise for the actual release, so we promise there\\u2019s more happening behind the scenes than what we\\u2019re showing! Before we move on to the Build of the Month, we also want to say a heartfelt thanks to everyone who backed the boardgame version of Valheim!

Build of the Month As per usual when we have skipped a blog post, we want to highlight two builds instead of one. This time, our eyes were caught by this village by Spac3_Sl0th . Looking cosy! The other build we want to highlight wasn\\u2019t actually tagged and submitted, but we just found the video of it so impressive that we wanted to show it off anyway. Well done, Ready-Cucumber-8922 !

We''ve got a patch full of fixes for you today, now live for everybody! Most importantly are probably those concerning gamepads, as they were having some significant issues. But with the new fixes in place, everything should be back to normal! Aside from the gamepad issues, this patch also addresses some issues with the new skills, some tweaks to the Asksvin Cape, and more! Patch Notes: Fixes & Improvements: * Gamepad navigation in menus is no longer jittery and too quick to use * Fixed an issue causing renaming of signs and portal with gamepads to break * Adjusted gamepad dead zones * There is no longer movement stuttering when using certain inputs * There should no longer be a stutter when getting close to the bog witch hut * Virtual keyboard no longer appears multiple times * Multiple players can no longer eat the same piece of served food * Crafting skill no longer provides bonus yield on armour and weapons * You no longer gain cooking skill by trying to use a full cooking station * World modifier \\u201cNo Build Cost\\u201d no longer allows food to be placed freely, this is now part of the \\u201cNo Craft Cost\\u201d world modifier * Resin candles that have been blown out no longer start burning when logging into a server * Resin candles no longer sink into the surface they are placed on * Asksvin Cape has been reworked with increased run speed and reduced stamina use for running Please note: There are some issues with Dedicated server in Steam''s anonymous mode for Linux, which might cause some dedicated servers on third party server hosts to not start. This appears to be an issue not specific to Valheim, but we hope to see a solution as soon as possible!

\"Modding FAQ for the Asset Bundle update 0.217.40 - Valheim About News Media Press Support Facebook Wiki Discord Bluesky Buy Now Modding FAQ for the Asset Bundle update post 0.217.40 March 12, 2024 Versions 0.217.40 and later of Valheim has moved from using Unity''s standard asset management to using a custom asset management system called Soft Referencable Assets that loads assets via Asset Bundles. This enables the game to load and unload assets on the fly, rather than always keeping everything in memory, which saves massive amounts of RAM. To assist the modding community in this transition, we''ve collected some common questions and answer them here. Which assets are affected by this change? All assets in the entire game are now stored in Asset Bundles rather than \\\"level\\\" and \\\"sharedassets\\\" files. However, this in and of itself doesn''t affect when assets are loaded into memory. So far only Locations (in ZoneSystem and LocationList components) and Rooms (stored in DungeonDB, utilized in DungeonGenerator) are loaded and unloaded dynamically. ObjectDB and ZNetScene remain unaffected for now and always keep their assets in memory, just like before. The plan is to dynamically load and unload the assets in ObjectDB and ZNetScene eventually too, but that will come in a later update. How is the new asset management system integrated into the game? The Soft Referenceable Assets system is self-contained and included in a separate assembly. Valheim''s scripts use the various types and function calls in this assembly in order to load and unload assets and scenes from the built Asset Bundles. Assets are referenced by a 128-bit AssetID . This ID is the same as the GUID generated for each asset by the Unity Editor. When the Soft Referenceable Assets system builds Asset Bundles, it generates manifest files that maps each asset''s AssetID to the Asset Bundle they''re stored in and their path within that Asset Bundle. The manifest files also contains dependency data for each Asset Bundle that has dependencies to other Asset Bundles.

SoftReference<T> struct and its member functions are used to load and unload assets. T is the type of the object being referenced, so for example a reference to a prefab would be SoftReference<GameObject> . The SoftReference<T> struct doesn''t hold state; it only acts as an interface to the global asset management system. In other words, if two SoftReference<T> instances load the same asset, the asset will be loaded once and both SoftReference<T> instances will point to the same asset. Reference counting is used to determine the lifetime of the loaded asset. More specifically: * SoftReference<T>.Load() - Increments the reference counter and loads the asset synchronously. * SoftReference<T>.LoadAsync() - Increments the reference counter and loads the asset asynchronously. * SoftReference<T>.HoldReference() - Increments the reference counter, but doesn''t implicitly load the asset. * SoftReference<T>.Release() - Decrements the reference counter and, if the reference counter hits 0, unloads the asset. When the reference counter of an asset hits 0, the asset is unloaded. For each function call incrementing the reference counter, there is exactly one matching function call decrementing the reference counter. My mod relies on certain assets remaining loaded. How do I prevent an asset from being unloaded? Mods can exploit the reference counting of the Soft Referenceable Assets system to keep assets loaded indefinitely. All they need to do is increment the reference counter of the asset they want to keep loaded one extra time, then never decrement it. Of course, forcing an asset to stay loaded comes at the cost of higher RAM usage. How do I know which asset is mapped to which AssetID ? The SoftReferenceableAssets.Runtime class has a function called GetAllAssetPathsInBundleMappedToAssetID() . This function returns a dictionary with one entry for each loadable asset, where the key is the \\\"path\\\" of the asset in the Asset Bundle it''s stored in (which is identical to the asset''s path in the project) and the value is the AssetID for that asset.

can parse the asset path to get the file name and file type of the asset. Please note that the asset path might change during development, so if your mod relies on a certain asset having a certain path, it''s likely that an update will break your mod. Names of prefabs that are synchronized across the network should stay same throughout development since the networking system uses the prefab names to identify them. The AssetID however will always stay the same for each asset even if it''s moved or renamed. If you need to reference individual assets, it''s best to parse the dictionary during development to find the AssetID ''s of the assets you need to reference, then store those AssetID in your shipped mod. A certain asset in the vanilla game is a dependency of my mod. Is it possible to individually load that asset? Yes, we added support for invidivudally loading any asset in the game after discussing this update with the modding community. The game includes two manifest files in the Valheim_Data/StreamingAssets/SoftReferenceableAssets folder, one called manifest and another one called manifest_extended . The manifest file contains all data required to load assets that are referenced by AssetID in the vanilla game. The manifest_extended file contains all additional data required to load any asset by AssetID , including assets that are only dependencies of other assets. By default, only the manifest file is loaded, because it''s the only file needed for the vanilla game. However, if you call Runtime.MakeAllAssetsLoadable() before the Soft Referenceable Assets system is initialized (before the EntryPointSceneLoader.Start() function in this case), the manifest_extended file is loaded too. You can then individually load any asset using SoftReference<T>.Load() or SoftReference<T>.LoadAsync() (and remember to unload it using SoftReference<T>.Release() when you no longer need it). It''s worth noting that Asset Bundles are packed in a way that is optimized for the vanilla game, so memory usage and load times are not as efficient when loading vanilla assets that are not referenced by AssetID in the vanilla game. Can I load Asset Bundles from my mod via the Soft Referencable Assets system?

Assuming that you ship your Asset Bundles as files, you can load them via the Soft Referenceable Assets system. Each Asset Bundle is uniquely identified internally by its file name. You can name your Asset Bundles anything you''d like; just make sure you give them names that are unlikely to conflict with the vanilla game or other mods. Vanilla assets always take precedence in case of conflicts. Export your appropriately named Asset Bundles to a folder, packed in any way you like. The system supports any asset packing layout, since the locations of assets and bundle dependency data is specified inside of a manifest file. The next step is to create said manifest file for your Asset Bundles. Manifest files are stored in a YAML-like text format, though in contrast to true YAML, order matters. See the manifest files included with the vanilla game and the SoftReferenceableAssets.AssetBundleManifest classes for reference. We''ve explicitly included the AssetBundleManifest.SerializeToDisk(string path, SerializationFormat format) function in the player build to make this a bit easier. Provide the absolute path of your custom manifest file to the Soft Referenceable Assets system by calling Runtime.AddManifest(string manifestPath) before it''s initialized (before the EntryPointSceneLoader.Start() function in this case). Manifest files added this way are then loaded alongside the vanilla manifest files when the Soft Referenceable Assets system is initialized. After that, you can load your mod''s assets by their AssetID , with all of the same reference counting and dependency management features of the vanilla game.

The update also features new skills and tools for homesteading!

Counting Down September 26, 2024 Greetings vikings! Autumn is well and truly here, and it\\u2019s time for another run-down of what\\u2019s new! First off, let\\u2019s start with what\\u2019s most imminent. The Valheim board game is getting ready to launch its Gamefound campaign, so make sure to check it out if you haven\\u2019t already. The campaign goes live on October 1st, and we promise you don\\u2019t want to miss it! If any of you happen to be in Germany and have plans to attend the Essen Game Fair, SPIEL, MOOD will also be there to show off the game. Come say hi! Something else to keep an eye out for is also The Spill , a livestream that Box Dragon and Coffee Stain will be hosting on the 8th of October. Plenty of games under the Coffee Stain umbrella, including Valheim, will have developers present to talk about the past, present and future. Keep an eye out on our socials for more information on the schedule and the exact timings, and we hope to see you in the stream chat! During the stream we will look back on the Ashlands development, but we will also be talking a bit about the future update that we started teasing a bit in the last blog post. In August we showed you a hut in the Swamps, and this time we want to give you a little sneak peek of what it looks like within: Before we sign off we also want to remind you all that we have shared another freelancer interview! This time it was Ghostwood Empire , the people behind the trailer music and the sound design of Valheim, who told us a bit about their process. It even includes a deeper look into the sound design of the gjall, and an exclusive peek into the components of that distinctive call! And finally we want to make a shoutout to the wiki volunteers: the Valheim wiki has gotten itself a visual overhaul, which you can enjoy any time you want to look up any interesting facts. Thanks, wiki volunteers!

Empire September 19, 2024 Aside from the main crew at Iron Gate, Valheim also benefits from the contribution of some talented freelancers. We want to give them a chance to introduce themselves and their work, and for you to get to know them a bit better! You''ve already met lore writer Lee Williams , key artist Mats Minnhagen, and trailer makers Brikk Animation , but now we''re tuning into Ghostwood Empire! The people behind the company \\u2013 Dennis and Inez \\u2013 create both the audio for Valheim and its trailers, as well as the trailer music. Who are you? What\\u2019s your background? We''re a composer duo who run Ghostwood Empire Studios . A company that specializes in composing music for games, film and trailers as well as sound design for games and linear media. Our names are Inez Kontio and Dennis Filatov and we''ve been doing this for about a decade. How did you get into making audio and music? We both started out playing in different bands and that''s where we got passionate about songwriting and music production. Eventually we both realized that being on stage wasn''t for us, and being in the studio was way more fun. Inez: After leaving the band I knocked on a few doors and behind one was Dennis. We immediately clicked and started writing music together and haven''t stopped since. I still can''t believe we get to do this every day! Do you play a lot of Valheim yourself to get inspiration? Do you have other things that inspire you? Dennis: I have about 250 hours in Valheim and definitely get back to that world when it''s time to write new music or create new sounds for the game! As for the source of inspiration I think we both get inspired by so many different things. It could be a piece of lore, films, games or live concerts. For Valheim it''s been especially fun to listen to artists perform with authentic Nordic instruments and get immersed in that soundscape. Inez: I haven''t played it yet but I heard it''s a decent game.

Could you tell us a bit about your creative process? What does it look like from the idea stage to the finished work? Usually we start off by having a discussion together with the team or the creative director on a project and we spend time aligning ourselves creatively so we understand the vision and what is needed. Usually there''s a brief involved with key words on mood and a general direction. After that we talk about what cool ideas we''d love to try and once we''ve decided we start working on the track. When we''re finished with the first version that we feel matches the vision and is worthy of showing to the team, we present it. If the draft gets approved we continue working on it until it''s done. Usually all it takes to start a piece of music is a specific sound that sets the mood or a melody. Sometimes even lyrics pop up in our minds that can get an idea going. Dennis: One of the most exciting sounds to create was the Gjall for the Mistlands update. No one really knows this but the base of the sound is actually a sample of a female vocal. We were working on the trailer music during the same period and had been using this virtual instrument with female vocals. It was cool because I could control the pitch of the vocals and create short 1-3 note sequences. So if you want to know how the sound was made, read on! The base layer is a female vocal, which I then pitched down. Then I added more low harmonics to make it bassy and boomy. At this point I felt that the sound was lacking a few things but mostly energy and movement so I added another pitch shifter, automated a few parameters and ran it through some really gritty distortion. After that I felt that the sound needed some organic layers. I imagined a clicking, almost gurgling sound because of how nasty that thing looks. So I found some sounds of a seal grunting and started experimenting. As usual when working with creatures I listen back to a sound in different pitches and speeds to see if there is something interesting and usable that I can incorporate into the design.

raw seal grunt was pitched waaay down. After that I enhanced the clicks and a bunch of other processing that I topped off with a formant filter. There were other layers and more stuff going on with the final sounds but the female vocals and the seal made up the majority of what you hear and recognize. You can watch the video to hear the process: What piece that you have made for Valheim (so far) are you most proud of? Definitely Deya Saga! It''s the piece of music that started it all for us in the world of Valheim. With the score to the Ashlands Animated Trailer as a close second just because of how fun it was writing that to the intense visuals. Is there anything you specifically like about working with Valheim? Is there anything that\\u2019s particularly challenging? The fact that we get to write with more Nordic themes and instruments is really cool. Dennis: As a sound designer I love whenever there''s a new update and I get to create sounds for the new creatures. Working on Abomination and Fallen Valkyrie were highlights for me. The biggest challenge is probably the balance of staying in the Valheim world sonically but still being able to add new and fresh ideas to the music. If you were a viking, what would be your role in a village? Dennis: I''d wish to be some cool bowman but in reality I''d probably be some form of Skald and maker of crappy instruments. Inez: I would be some kind of viking party planner. Can''t imagine how fun it would be to grab a few meads and have a good old viking party!

the end, our home base only needs two portals. Just change the tag! PART VII \\u2013 END GAME Congratulations. You have completed all of the core content available in Valheim; however, you probably haven\\u2019t scratched the surface of building and skill improvement for your character. And make no mistake, raising the skill levels of your character makes a big difference for damage, run speed, and other factors. Building This is one of the greatest features of Valheim, and the majority of players only scratch the surface. Players have the ability to completely transform the world they are playing in. Build castles, paved roads, docks for ships, defensive structures, and more. Replanting trees with the seeds you picked up is an essential part of the game. You can quickly plant a forest of stacked lumber that, when cut, falls like dominoes. Also, remember all of that stone you piled while mining Copper and Silver? Just take the portals, grab the stacks and bring it back to your base for some great stonework building. Trying all Weapons & Improving Character Skills Have you 1-shot backstabbed a Troll? Snuck into a Fuling camp? How about trained in Polearms and learned to properly kite tough mobs without parry/block, but used the Atgeir spinning attack? Have you crafted a +4 version of a Blackmetal Knife or Sword? Craft different weapons and see how you like the adjusted play styles; also, build your main character. Skill points make a huge difference in damage, movement and other factors. Improve those Block, Running, Jumping and Sneak skills! Hardcore Challenge & Replaying the game One of the most popular methods of re-playing Valheim for experienced players is self-imposed Hardcore Mode. If you die, you delete the character and world, and start again with a random seed. Also starting a new game with a random seed and new character, but not imposing a Hardcore challenge is another great way to re-experience the game. Multiplayer & Dedicated Servers Think Valheim is fun playing solo?

\"While there is the option for PvP (which is really most useful for raising skills like Shield Block), the game isn\\u2019t really designed for PvP; it\\u2019s designed for collaboration. It\\u2019s awesome to log out of your server and come back in the next day and see one of your friends started building a huge new castle in that field you once hunted deer in. Animal Taming You can tame Wild Hogs, Wolves, and Lox. There are numerous guides on how to do this, and it can be fun having these creatures casually running around your base and even defending you and your area when it falls under attack. Helping Others If you join a Discord community and get to know other players, many people often need help recovering their bodies or with boss fights. There\\u2019s even a Discord group that specializes in helping people recover their bodies. If you build a character up (legit) and have great skills and gear, you may be perfect for helping other people in bad situations. Never Cheat To truly enjoy Valheim, never cheat. Always play per the game\\u2019s rules. This is much more satisfying than using cheat codes to faceroll the game. CONCLUSION Thanks to the team at Iron Gate for making one of the best games ever!

Josh says: May 12, 2021 at 1:46 pm Hey man, just finished the game recently with a friend recently thanks to this guide! We ignored the Hardcore aspect of the guide though, and the game was getting a bit TOO grindy near the end because having to search for iron once again was tiring to build the end game armor. So we just took our Silver armor, top-tier food and beat the final boss\\u2019 ass. Was a scary fight, but it was done deathless on the first try! Unfortunately those fulings and mosquitoes really made it a headache while trying to kite the boss around. Not to mention that we also did all of the game on a different seed. And oh boy, trying to find a merchant is like finding a needle in a haystack. We looked at about 6-8 black forests in other islands before giving up. So we used your world seed to establish a spawn near the merchant you marked out. Just wanted to say that we highly appreciate the effort you put into the guide. It has been crazy fun. Also, are you not interested in Path of Exile\\u2019s current league? I dont see a 3.14 build statistics as of now.

David Allen says: May 13, 2021 at 4:53 am Wow, it sounds like you had an awesome adventure! Replaying Valheim with different seeds is always a unique experience. I can\\u2019t wait for the first expansion! I\\u2019ve gotten kind of burned out on PoE, and there just wasn\\u2019t enough variation in end-game builds this league to draw me to making a league overview. The bad air exists for a reason, and I\\u2019m in agreement with many of the complaints. It\\u2019s sad we aren\\u2019t seeing real game-enhancing mechanics like Delve provided. Running around in a circle while monsters spawn IMO is a very poor and lackluster design compared to what more could have been done \\ud83d\\ude42 Thanks a ton for the feedback and support \\u2013 happy hunting! Sam says: January 8, 2023 at 2:30 am Just wanted to say how much I appreciated having this guide and the tremendous amount of work you put into it. I just started my first ever playthrough a couple weeks ago and am about to kill the plains boss. Just thought you\\u2019d like to know people are still appreciating your work after all this time. PS, I saw you were into PoE, I\\u2019m sure you\\u2019ve seen already but the newest league is supposed to be great so might be worth another try. Also Diablo 2 Resurrected is fantastic IMO if you haven\\u2019t checked that out. Thanks again! -Sam David Allen says: January 8, 2023 at 7:59 am Thanks! Have you checked out the new Mistlands version of the guide? I see the comment is under the old guide; if not, definitely check it out \\u2013 it\\u2019s the main post on the first page. Yes, I still play PoE, but I stopped posting compendiums of builds and such because the game has grown stagnant IMO, and even though many changes of 3.20 are good, I find the new Sanctum mechanic to be terrible. I wish they would do more mechanics like Delve, Breach, and Abyss. I haven\\u2019t been drawn to D2R.

Bluesky Buy Now Development Blog: New and Improved August 27, 2024 Hello vikings! As you may have noticed, there was no blog post in July, but now we\\u2019re back again to give you your long-awaited Valheim news! Patch-wise, what\\u2019s new since the last blog post is that you can now find patch 0.218.21 live! It offers a bunch of tweaks and bug fixes which we hope you\\u2019ll enjoy, and we want to offer a big thank you to everyone who tested it in the PTB! Something you might have noticed over the summer, if you follow us on social media, is that we have gradually revealed more information about the Valheim board game! Together with MOOD we have shown off the player character minis as well as the bosses included \\u2013 which will be Eikthyr, The Elder, Bonemass and Moder, since the board game will cover the first four Valheim biomes. The Gamefound page has also been updated with a more detailed explanation of the gameplay and a preview of what you\\u2019ll find in the game box itself. We really recommend that you follow the Gamefound page, because those who do will get a free ship mini if they back the project! But now, back to the video game! We\\u2019re of course starting to look beyond the Ashlands and towards the future, and we\\u2019re working on a little something that will be with you during the fall\\u2026 We won\\u2019t reveal all that it entails yet, but it will include some overhaul and corrections of Hildir\\u2019s wares and her camp. We\\u2019ve got a small before and after comparison for you right here to preview: Aside from some overhauls and improvements, there\\u2019s also something brand new brewing in the Swamps. What do you think this might be\\u2026? Build of the Month Since we didn\\u2019t have a blog post in July, we\\u2019ll share two builds this month! First out is JJTheBuilder89 with this mighty bastion: The second build we want to highlight is this mansion by Dream_Psalms . Well built both of you!

fishing bait * Immobilised tooltip will no longer show unnecessary stats * Loading screen will now freeze the window for a much shorter period. * The intro will now start playing while loading to shorten the overall loading time when starting the game for the first time. * You can now cycle through hints in the loading screen * Localization tweaks Mac: * Ping icon is now correct on non-singleplayer servers on Mac * Tweaks to functionality for scrolling to make it less resource expansive, noticeable on weaker systems. * Fixed an issue to make sure to register the Game Center platform id without the \\\"A:_\\\" prefix, since that would later break the parsing of the platform ID when adding players to the player list since it expects only one underscore to be present in the string. This would''ve caused issues with muting players via the player list, but with this fix, muting works as expected with MAS players. Xbox: * Fixed a crash issue that could happen when suspending the game * Pins on the minimap on Xbox is now a reasonable size on 4K displays * Fixed a bug that made the game think that every player in the player list was the local player. This bug was the root cause of multiple issues since privilege checks became completely broken. This impacted Managing Player Communication, Display Name and GamerPic, and Maintaining Multiplayer Session State. * Fixed a bug concerning Joinable Game Sessions and Online Play * Fixed an error on Xbox One caused by Mouse.current returning null if if no mouse is plugged in Social Community Valheim\\u2019s community is thriving and friendly place to be, so why not join the growing fan base and sign up to our official newsletter.

\"Valheim: Patch 0.218.19 - Valheim About News Media Press Support Facebook Wiki Discord Bluesky Buy Now Patch 0.218.19 July 1, 2024 Hello vikings! Today we have a hotfix for you, to solve some critical crashes. Please do keep in mind that this hotfix applies to the previous Live build (0.218.15), and that it does not contain any of the changes from the current PTB (0.218.17). The PTB changes will continue to be worked on, and they will be released to the Live game eventually! Detailed Patch Notes: Fixes & Improvements: * Fixed a rare case where the server list could permanently break if adding an IPv6 dedicated server, making players unable to join multiplayer games via the server list. * Prefer IPv4 over IPv6, fixing some issues with connecting to dedicated servers. * Fixed a number of issues related to deleting the user''s PlayFab account. * Block navigation of tab menus with keyboard when a popup is shown. * Update game icon on Mac App Store and Microsoft Store. Mac: * Fixed some issues that broke privilege checks against, muting and chat messages from Mac App Store players. * Reverse piece placement rotation on MacOS so it matches the other versions of the game. * Use windowed fullscreen on MacOS. * Fixed an issue where quality settings were reset every time the game was restarted on MacOS. * Fixed map pinging when typing \\\"p\\\" in a pin name on MacOS. * Fix stuttery mouse input on older Intel Macs.

No, Valheim can be played either as a singleplayer or a co-op game. But we would of course highly recommend you to play it with a few friends if possible! Does Valheim have a Sandbox mode? No, it does not. It might be something that gets added in the future, however. The visuals of Valheim look kind of old, what\\u2019s up with that? We have chosen a stylised graphical look that blends low-resolution textures and sparse polygonal detail with modern materials, lighting and post effects. The visuals are inspired by the early days of 3D graphics, like the style seen in PS1 titles and old DOS-era 3D games (before hardware acceleration and texture filtering was a thing).

Valheim is currently available on Windows, Linux, Mac and Xbox, and can be purchased via Humble, Steam, the Mac App Store or the Microsoft Store, as well as being available with PC Game Pass and Xbox Game Pass. Does Valheim support gamepad? Yes! Valheim has full controller support. This also includes being verified for Steam Deck. What resolution is available for Xbox?

\"Some items can be customised, like choosing paint jobs for almost every shield and picking colours on linen capes. More customisation might happen in the future, but right now we\\u2019re focusing on the mechanics and general contents of the game. Can I customise the appearance of my viking? The Player character is fully customisable with the choice of two body types and a number of different hairstyles, beards, and complexions. By building the Barber Station, you can also customise your character later during the game, accessing some special hair and beard styles. Will I be able to use mods? We don\\u2019t have official support for mods. You can read more about our stance on modding the game here . What happened to the Itch.io version of Valheim? The ancient Itch.io (Alpha) release of Valheim has been removed from the Itch.io site due to it not really reflecting the state of the game any longer. If you are in possession of the Itch.io version you are free to share it as you wish, but we won\\u2019t be providing any support for it going forward. Do you still accept donations for the development of Valheim? We have signed a publishing agreement with Coffee Stain Publishing and will therefore no longer accept monetary donations. Chocolate and other sweets are still welcome :) How much does the game cost? The pricing varies depending on your local currency. Check the storefront you want to purchase from for the exact price! Early Access Questions Why is Valheim available for Early Access? We want to make the best game we can, and even in Beta we\\u2019ve learnt that working directly with our community is the best way to do that. Valheim is a huge world and we have lots that we want to add, and Early Access is a way for us to receive constant valuable feedback, collaborate with our players on what they want to see, and keep our players in mind at every step of the development cycle. For how long will Valheim be in Early Access? It\\u2019s hard to say! It will likely take a couple of years, but we don\\u2019t have any set dates. It\\u2019ll be ready when it\\u2019s ready.

\"Each biome will have its own gameplay loop with resources, enemies, craftable and buildable items, and a boss. Do you have a roadmap? While we did release a roadmap back when Valheim launched into Early Access back in February 2021, we decided to roll it back to prioritise bug fixes and stability issues when the game launched due to the sheer amount of players that started playing. Since then, we\\u2019ve released Hearth & Home and a couple smaller updates to flesh out the existing in-game biomes, and we recently released the Mistlands, our first full biome update. We\\u2019ve decided not to share a new roadmap as we want to be flexible when it comes to the development of Valheim. We are constantly iterating on the existing content in the game as we release new biomes, enemies and resources. How long is the development process? This depends on the type of update; how big it is and how much pre-production it needs. Aside from some pre-production, our development timeline since the Early Access release has looked roughly like this: - February 2021 - April 2021: Bug fixing to ensure the game ran smoothly for our massive influx of new players. - May 2021 - September 2021: Main development of Hearth & Home - October 2021 - November 2021: Bug fixing for Hearth & Home, as well as developing the Abomination, and starting the development of the Frost Caves - December 2021 - February 2022: Main development of the Frost Caves - March 2022 - December 2022: Main development of the Mistlands - January 2023 - August 2023: Hildir''s Request in development, parallell to Ashlands development - January 2023 - May 2024: Ashlands in development, parallell to Hildir''s Request - May 2024 - October 2024: The Bog Witch in development, parallel to Deep North pre-production - May 2024 - October 2024: Deep North in pre-production, parallel to Bog Witch development - October 2024 - present: Deep North in development Gameplay questions Is there a lot to explore in Valheim?

\"Every biome has its own challenging environment, enemies and secrets to discover. Travel through deep forests, through harsh snowstorms in the mountains or sail the high seas if you dare. If you\\u2019re not the outdoorsy type, there are plenty of dungeons, crypts and caves for you to explore as well. Valheim sounds very big. What other means are there to travel other than running? You can craft three different types of boats to use for sailing from place to place, as well as portals that can take you wherever you want. How does crafting work? You can build many different workbenches and crafting stations like kilns, smelters and windmills that you can use for refining raw materials. Use the materials you have gathered to craft an array of different armours, weapons and tools. You can also build boats and bases. Can I build my own bases from the ground up? Yes! We have a robust construction system where you can choose from different types of floors, walls, roofs and furniture to build and decorate your base in any way you might want. Our players have built anything from little fishing villages to enormous castles. What do you want to build? Do you eat in Valheim? There are many types of food in Valheim, from mushrooms and berries to pies and fish wraps that all come with different attributes. Eating food is not vital for survival in Valheim, but your total health and stamina depends on it. You are able to cultivate the grounds around your base to farm your own materials, and you can tame animals and keep them in pens to later use their meat. What does the progression look like in Valheim? Every biome comes with its own difficulty and unique resources for crafting armour and weapons. To conquer a biome you have to defeat its corresponding Forsaken One in a brutal boss battle, then use your newly gained items and skills to move on to the next one. Defeat all the Forsaken Ones and conquer their lands to carry out Odin\\u2019s mission. I\\u2019ve found a bug in the game, how can I report it?

\"Where can I leave suggestions for the game? We collect all player suggestions in our discord server: https://discord.com/invite/valheim There you can find the channel labelled #suggestions, and you can tell us about your idea by following the rules stated in the channel. I found an issue with the translation of the game. How can I report that? Fill in the form on our support page ! Tell us what word or phrase is wrong, and give us your new suggestion. However, we''re not looking for additional people to help localize the game. What happens to my world when there\\u2019s a big update? Any update to the game that adds new content fixed in the world (such as new terrain, buildings or dungeons) will only be applied to previously unexplored areas. An unexplored area is an area where no player has set foot, including a radius of about 500 metres. When new updates are released, you will either need to travel to new areas or start a new world to experience the new content. The reason for updates not affecting previously explored areas is mainly to avoid ruining player-built structures. Multiplayer questions Is there any PVP in Valheim? Although the main focus of Valheim is PVE, we support consensual PVP. Players that wish to bash each other over the head have to turn on the friendly fire setting from the Inventory-screen. Is there any in-game communication in Valheim? Valheim supports in-game chat, but you\\u2019ll have to use dedicated software such as Discord or TeamSpeak for voice communication. How many Players can play at the same time? Valheim is not an MMO, but rather a co-op game meant to be played with a couple of friends. Servers are capped at 10 players. How does a multiplayer-server work? When starting the game you can create your own p2p-based play session that can be either public or private. If you wish to run a persistent server you can download the Valheim Dedicated Server-application from Steam. Iron Gate does not provide any official servers, nor do we have any access to your saved worlds or characters. Iron Gate Questions Tell me a little about yourselves!

Currently the company consists of fourteen people, though not everyone is a developer directly involved in the production of Valheim. Our publishing partner Coffee Stain Publishing helps us with many aspects of the business such as marketing and other business stuff, and we also contract some talented freelancers for certain aspects of the game. The company was founded in 2019, after Valheim had already been worked on for two years as a solo project, and by then consisted of the two co-founders and one employee. Two more employees were added over the following year, and another two joined right after Valheim\\u2019s launch into Early Access. Since then the team has continued to grow slightly every now and then, but our ambition is to remain a small and independent company. Can I apply for an internship? Are you hiring more people? Right now we aren''t looking for any more people to join the team. We are also unfortunately unable to accept any interns at this time.

updated 18 May 2021 We at Coffee Stain Publishing AB are thrilled that you want to use the content of our games for your own creative project and want to support you. To help with this we have put together these guidelines. If your project is not commercial then we are happy for you to use our content provided that you follow the rules below. For commercial projects this is only permitted if you follow the rules including the specific additional rules for commercial purposes to ensure that what you are doing is creative or educational. These rules only apply to Coffee Stain content and not for anything owned by anyone else. If you want to use other non-Coffee Stain material then there may be other rules around that. If you are using any content it is up to you to check who owns it as, for instance, we may use music from a third party in our games. Only once a game or some content from it has been officially promoted or released can it be used. You are not permitted to use any unauthorised, leaked or unofficially released content. You can use the content, gameplay videos and screenshots of our games to produce your own creative content such as reviews, commentary videos, tutorials or walkthroughs to be release on platforms like Twitch, Facebook and YouTube and these can be through your own channel. What this means is that simply copying the content of our games without any creative input or comments is prohibited. You have to add something to the content and make it beneficial or entertaining. If you want to monetise this please see the rule covering this at 12. Don\\u2019t ruin it for other people by having spoilers or if you want to then make sure that you add a spoiler disclaimer before anyone sees the spoiler. Should you decide to use content owned by third parties (whether those are taken from our games or anywhere else) such as the music, logos, marks etc. you will need to get permission from the owners of this so please check what rules they might have. Please note that the music in our games might not be owned by us and just licensed to us to use in the game.

Lately we have been getting a lot of questions regarding mods, and what we as a company approve of \\u2013 as well as what we don\\u2019t approve of. Therefore we thought we\\u2019d try and clear things up a little bit. First of all, while we don\\u2019t have any official mod support, we are definitely happy to see that people are engaging with our game and creating their own mods for it. It\\u2019s definitely flattering that you want to be creative and add your own ideas! Iron Gate not having any official mod support essentially means that any creating and using of mods is done at your own risk, and that we can\\u2019t guarantee that mods will be compatible with newer versions of the game. The thing that we\\u2019ve been getting the most questions about, however, is the phenomenon where mods cost money. We definitely understand that you spend a lot of your time on creating a mod, and that you might want financial compensation for that, but Iron Gate does not condone locking modded content behind a paywall. We feel that charging money for a mod is against the creative and open spirit of modding itself, and therefore we urge all mod authors to make their mods freely available to all who want to play them. This should include the whole mod, and not just have part of the mod available for free while another part of it costs money. If you want to show your appreciation for a mod author you can of course still support them with a voluntary donation, but we do not want payment to be a requirement to access a mod. Additionally, we would also greatly appreciate it if mods made it clear that they are unofficial mods, both in game and on any website where the mod is available. Sometimes joining a modded dedicated server will automatically trigger a download of a mod, and we simply want to avoid confusion for players so that they can know whether or not they are playing a modded game. Valheim already has a feature for this, where you can simply have your mod trigger a popup in game, which will inform the player that their game is running with a mod.

that you might have a lot of questions about the game right now, concerning the Microsoft Store, Xbox, Game Pass, or crossplay. We have collected some of the most important ones here, but if you can''t find your answer please don''t hesitate to contact us. More generic questions you might find an answer to in our regular FAQ . How can I join friends who own the game on a different platform? When you start a server through the game or by hosting a dedicated server, you\\u2019ll be able to see a \\u201cJoin code\\u201d by entering the pause menu. Copy the code by simply clicking on it and send it to your friend! Your friend will then have to head over to the \\u201cJoin Game\\u201d section, press \\u201cAdd server\\u201d and paste the code. I bought the game through the Microsoft Store and want to set up a dedicated server, how do I do that? To launch a dedicated server you\\u2019ll need to navigate to the \\u2018Server\\u2019 folder that will be created when you install the game and run the \\u2018StartHeadlessServer.bat\\u2019 file. Before launching the server, we strongly recommend you to read the \\u2018Valheim Dedicated Server Manual\\u2019 found in the same folder. If you have the game through the Microsoft store your files will be stored in the following folder: C:\\\\XboxGames\\\\Valheim\\\\Content\\\\Server How do dedicated servers work on Xbox? You can''t set up a dedicated server on an Xbox. However, you can join a dedicated server from an Xbox console just as normal, provided that both your Xbox and the server have crossplay enabled. If you can''t find the option to enable crossplay, you might need to adjust your parental control settings. If I buy the game on Microsoft Store, will I also be able to play it on Xbox? Yes, and vice versa! I already own the game on Steam. Am I able to launch the game through Microsoft Store? No. These are two separate platforms. You can still play with your friends from different platforms though! What\\u2019s the difference between the Microsoft Store, Xbox and Steam versions?

All versions of Valheim will continue to be updated at the same pace. I bought the game on a platform I don\\u2019t like. Can I get a refund so I can buy the game on a different platform? Refunds are decided by each platform, and you are subject to their terms of purchase when you buy the game. Please contact the customer service for the platform you purchased from regarding refunds. Why did you spend time on adding crossplay to the game instead of working on new content? The people working on the Microsoft and Xbox port are from two separate teams from external companies (Piktiv and Fishlabs). Internally here at Iron Gate Studio we\\u2019re still focused on creating new content for the game. Are there ever any preview builds available that I can help out testing? If you play on Steam you can help us out via the Public Test Branch. In order to opt in, please read the instructions here . If you play through the Microsoft Store or on Xbox you can opt into the Flight version of the game. To do this, launch the Xbox Insider Hub app. Navigate to \\u2018Previews\\u2019, and then find \\u2018Valheim Public Test\\u2019. Select \\u2018Join\\u2019. Wait for the registration to be complete to be directed to the Store and then install \\u2018Valheim Public Test\\u2019. Please leave your feedback in our Discord server, in the specific #public-test-feedback channel there. You will need to react to the post in #rules-and-info in order to get access to this channel. Remember that these versions of the game will likely be less stable than the default version of the game. I\\u2019ve found a bug/issue. Where can I report such findings? Go to https://valheimbugs.featureupvote.com/ . Please make your report in English, and make sure to include as much information about the issue as you are able.

Getting Ready for the Ashlands March 26, 2024 Before you set sail towards the Ashlands update there are a couple of things we recommend that you keep in mind. For the sake of convenience, we have compiled them here for you! Public Test Branch Recommendations First of all, if you\\u2019re playing the Ashlands update during the Public Test, the usual recommendations are still in place. For example, remember to make backups of your worlds and characters if you want to be able to use them in the non-PTB version of the game in the meantime, as they might not be backwards compatible with older versions. If you\\u2019re playing on a server, or with friends, everyone must be on the PTB, otherwise you will not be able to connect. All the PTB information are available here as always. Terrain Generation and New Content As always, new content will only be generated properly in previously unexplored areas of the game. Therefore, if you have already explored a lot of the Ashlands, the update will not generate properly in that world and we recommend that you start a new one. If you haven\\u2019t explored the Ashlands, you should get the new content, but we always recommend that you start a new world for the best possible experience . You can of course start a new world with an older character, if you don\\u2019t want to play through the whole game again before being able to conquer the Ashlands. Additionally, the Ashlands update features some significant changes to the terrain generation around the Ashlands, and the outer rim of Valheim worlds. The Ashlands will only be accessible by ship, and the terrain around it has been lowered and turned to ocean. This also affects any buildings you might have in that area \\u2013 if they are built on terrain that gets altered, they will collapse. The images below illustrate what happens to a spawned location versus what happens to a player built structure. As you can see, even if the spawned building remains intact, it will be rather difficult to reach it, as the terrain around it is vastly lower.

you have done so on an earlier playthrough, remember that her dropped item is no longer a placeholder. Just like Eikthyr\\u2019s antler lets you craft a pickaxe needed in the Black Forest, and just like The Elder drops a crypt key for the Swamps, the item from The Queen will be useful in the Ashlands! If you have the item already, you might need to toss it out of your inventory and pick it up again, for new recipes to trigger properly. We also want to remind everyone that Valheim is meant to be a difficult game, and that it\\u2019s meant to be more difficult the further you progress \\u2013 and the Ashlands is the penultimate biome of the game. If you\\u2019re confident in your skills, by all means, go forth! But if you haven\\u2019t played for a while or if you\\u2019re feeling a bit rusty, we recommend a bit of practice to get back into it, or that you adjust the difficulty in the World Modifiers menu. Mods Like every time when we update the game, it will take some time for mods to catch up and be playable again. If you\\u2019re using mods, it\\u2019s therefore recommended that you disable them before you download the Ashlands update, otherwise the game will most likely not launch properly. To disable mods you will also need to remove BepInEx or any other mod loader, as they might try to load regardless. If you don\\u2019t want to play without mods, you will most likely have to wait a couple of days until the mod creator has updated their mod to be compatible with Valheim again.

Guide to Dedicated Servers April 11, 2024 This guide tells you how to set up a dedicated server for Valheim (Steam version), as well as lists relevant console commands. You will find a copy of this guide when you download the dedicated server program. Running a dedicated server is a great way to provide a persistent world in which you and your friends can play anytime. Setting up a dedicated server requires some cursory scripting knowledge and, depending on your configuration, knowing how to set up your router to allow data to be sent to and from the server and its connected clients. This guide will help you script the server application but due to the multitude of router and modem types in use today, and differing internet connection setups, we can\\u2019t provide any detailed instructions on how to configure your router. Please refer to your router manual or ISP. Downloading the Dedicated Server program from Steam In the Steam Library, click the top left dropdown menu and make sure the \\u2018Tools\\u2019-checkbox is filled. Scroll down to \\u2018Valheim Dedicated Server\\u2019 and click \\u2018Install\\u2019. Running the Dedicated Server Before running the Server, you have to manually enter some relevant information in the \\u2018 start_headless_server.bat \\u2019-file (Linux: \\u2018 start_server.sh \\u2019). We recommend that you make a copy of this file and enter the required information in the copy instead of the original, since the original file will be reset each time it is updated in Steam (requiring you to re-enter your information). Just be aware that you won\\u2019t be able to launch the copy from Steam, since that shortcut only points to the original filename. PLEASE NOTE: If you\\u2019re using the Steam backend, the most important thing is to make sure that the Server uses a Port Range that has access to the Internet. This is done by \\u2018Port Forwarding\\u2019, please refer to your Router manual for details on how to do this. The default Port Range that the Server uses is 2456-2457.

Once you\\u2019re done setting up (don\\u2019t forget to save the file) you can start the Server either by launching it directly in Windows or via Steam.

Administrating the Server and setting permissions You can edit three separate text-files to set 1) who has admin privileges, 2) who is banned from your server, and 3) who is permitted on your server. These three files, located in the default save path, are called adminlist.txt , bannedlist.txt , and permittedlist.txt . Add one Platform User ID per line to set desired roles. The Platform User ID can be obtained from the Server log or from within the game using the F2 panel and follows the format [Platform]_[User ID] (case sensitive).

Banned - Lists all banned players. Required packages The Linux Steam client has a large overlap with Valheim dedicated server with respect to library requirement. The following additional packages are required: libatomic1 libpulse-dev libpulse0 Running via Docker The dedicated server has minimum requirements of GLIBC_2.29 and GLIBCXX_3.4.26. If your Linux installation uses older versions of those libraries, then one alternative to upgrading to a newer version is to run via Docker. Most distributions include a Docker package, installation instructions for several distributions can be found here . Make sure the docker daemon is running and that the user running the dedicated server is allowed to use docker, typically by being a member of the \\u2019docker\\u2019 group. The following command should succeed, make sure associated servers are started if you see this: $ docker ps Cannot connect to the Docker daemon at unix:///var/run/docker.sock. Is the docker daemon running? and make sure the logged in user is part of the \\u2018docker\\u2019 group if you see this: $ docker ps Got permission denied while trying to connect to the Docker daemon socket at unix:///var/run/docker.sock: Get http://%2Fvar%2Frun%2Fdocker.sock/v1.24/containers/json: dial unix /var/run/docker.sock: connect: permission denied Using the Docker script The dedicated server ships with a script named docker_start_server.sh location in the same directory as the start_server.sh script. Run the docker_start_server.sh and pass the server startup-script to run, either the copy you made, or start_server.sh $ ./docker_start_server.sh start_server.sh The script will run a boot-strap sequence where it builds the container environment the first time, which takes a few minutes. Consecutive runs will start right away. Game data is stored in the Docker volume named DOCKER_DATA_VOLUME in the docker_start_server.sh script.

Support Facebook Wiki Discord Bluesky Buy Now Welcome to the new Valheim support page! October 3, 2023 In this section, you will find various forms to help you out with feedback you might have for Valheim. For the time being, we have a form for suggesting corrections to the translations of the game, as well as forms for general feedback on the game and for bug reports. Before you report a bug, please check out the \\\"Known Issues\\\" tab, where you can see a list of bugs already reported! If you want to leave suggestions for new features, we do still prefer that you leave these in our Discord server, as the feedback forms are intended only for feedback on what is already in the game. Soon, you will also see various articles here where we walk you through the process of solving common issues. Social Community Valheim is still growing, and the community is an important part of the development.

December 8, 2023 Aside from the main crew at Iron Gate, Valheim also benefits from the contribution of some talented freelancers. We want to give them a chance to introduce themselves and their work, and for you to get to know them a bit better! Last time you met the artist Mats Minnhagen , and now it''s time to peek into the mind of the man behind a lot of Valheim''s story: Lee Williams. Who are you? What\\u2019s your background? I''m Lee Williams, a writer and games developer from the Isle of Wight. I''ve worked on a wide range of games, from Fall Guys to The Return of the Obra Dinn . I''m currently making a game called Cryptmaster , as well as continuing to write new lore for Valheim . How did you get into writing, both in general and for video games specifically? I started as a farm labourer and then I was an electricity linesman, a security guard and a tour guide. After this I taught English in rural China for about 5 years, moved back to the UK, got a degree and had a whole career in teaching and Special Education, before eventually striking off on another tangent and becoming a games writer\\u2026 To be clear, I''m pretty sure this isn''t the usual or optimal route into games writing! However, throughout all that time I read voraciously and for many years I wrote and published short stories. I kind of drifted into games writing when I helped out on a few indie projects that really interested me and it gradually grew to the point where I could make a living from it. Do you play a lot of Valheim yourself to get inspiration? Do you have other things that inspire you? Yes, I''ve played and still play a lot of Valheim.

bumbling efforts to survive. Aside from the game itself, my principal inspirations for the writing in Valheim are literary. I love the Poetic Edda and the sagas and I was happy for an excuse to read and reread them as I worked. Anyone else who is keen on Norse literature will probably spot quite a few nods and references throughout the game. I wrote most of the text for the game during the first lockdown, in a very rural area, so I also had plenty of time for a woolier sort of research. I took walks along the cliffs, swam in the sea, dug a pit oven with my sons and even attempted, with very limited success, to cook an authentic Viking meal. I did everything I could to feel like a real Viking, short of burning down a monastery. Could you tell us a bit about your creative process? I''m a great procrastinator and writing doesn''t always come easily. I can have a blank document open all day. Walking helps. Sticking to a strict schedule sometimes helps. Being away from internet access DEFINITELY helps. When I do start writing, I usually write a lot in a short space of time. I''m an overly wordy writer during the first draft but I''ve learned to be a really brutal editor of my own work. I never need to go back and expand on something I''ve written but I almost always need to cut it down. I can take a thousand-word piece of writing and chop it down to three or four hundred words very easily. Most of the runestones and dreams in Valheim went that way. If I find myself struggling to chop out something that I think is especially clever or witty then that''s usually a sure sign that it has to go! What piece of lore that you have come up with for Valheim (so far) are you most proud of? I''m proud of the general premise, tacking a tenth world onto Yggdrasil that basically gives us licence to do what we please with the story!

\"That was an accidental masterstroke that has made everything else much easier. Of the runestones and dreams, my favourites are the quieter ones, like the mother who remembers her child only as a phantom weight in the crook of her arm. Is there anything you specifically like about working with Valheim? Is there anything that\\u2019s particularly challenging? I like the freedom of it. It''s not a story game and the writing does not impact directly on the gameplay, so I have a free hand to write what I think best fits the mood. Short, disconnected vignettes like those found on the runestones are really fun and liberating to write. To be honest, the challenges particular to Valheim were all things I embraced. There is no dialogue, almost no NPCs, no fleshed-out player character, no quests, and no urgent central storyline to interfere with the sense of exploring at your own rate. These all place limits on the writing, but limits can be nice! If you were a viking, what would be your role in a village? I think I''d just sort of float. The other Vikings would assume I was doing something but they wouldn''t always know what. Somebody would say: \\\"Where''s Lee? I thought he was helping with the goats?\\\" Then somebody else might say: \\\"Oh, he told me he had to check the boundary fence.\\\" Probably I''m just having a nap somewhere. I''d see my role as mostly supervisory. Social Community Valheim\\u2019s community is thriving and friendly place to be, so why not join the growing fan base and sign up to our official newsletter.

October 19, 2023 Aside from the main crew at Iron Gate, Valheim also benefits from the contribution of some talented freelancers. We want to give them a chance to introduce themselves and their work, and for you to get to know them a bit better! First out is Mats Minnhagen, the artist responsible for the key art you will have seen on our social media and on this very website! Who are you? What\\u2019s your background? \\\"My name is Mats Minnhagen, I live in Sweden. I''ve been a freelance illustrator for some 15 years. My main focus has been book illustration, but I''ve also worked on and off in the game industry.\\\" How did you get into making art? \\\"I''ve always been drawing, and as a kid I wanted to become an illustrator. Then somehow I got distracted, and became an archaeologist instead. However, I gradually gravitated back towards illustration. My academic detour wasn''t wasted time though, since I often find myself doing historical scenes.\\\" Do you play a lot of Valheim yourself to get inspiration? Do you have other things that inspire you? \\\"I play Valheim myself, though in all honesty I''m a lousy gamer. I spend most of my time looking at the beautiful landscape, like a tourist. Fortunately there are plenty of youtubers out there eager to teach me how to play the game properly. As for other sources of inspiration, I often look at 19th century paintings, particularly historical scenes. I love the sense of storytelling in them, and even though my own paintings are more stylized, I try to borrow something of that into my Valheim illustrations.\\\" Could you tell us a bit about your creative process? What does it look like from the idea stage to the finished work? \\\"The first step is the idea. I try to avoid choosing scenes straight out of the game, instead trying to come up with some little story you won''t see ingame but which has a plausible feel to it. The game looks good already - I have to add something new.

I think in terms of what should be in focus, how to lead the eye there using values and shapes, creating balance and so on. Once I''m satisfied, I work out the anatomy of the characters and architectural elements. Aided by the thumbnail, I sketchily paint clothes, gear, background and anything else on top of the anatomy and architectural lines using broad brushes. I add light and shadows and work it out until the values look good and the scene is easily read. Once it looks good in greyscale, I add color. This will be my sketch. I prefer to send a sketch without lineart, as it''s a closer approximation to the final painting. Once the sketch is approved, I trace it with lines, refining it along the way. Aided by the tracing, I then mask out every single object and shape on separate layers. Locking those layers, I can easily paint within them using large brushes. Sometimes I just color pick from the sketch, at other times I paint flat colors first and build up shadows and light on separate layers. In the final stages, I flatten the multitude of layers into just a few main components and paint on top of those.\\\" What piece that you have made for Valheim (so far) are you most proud of? \\\"The Yule painting is my favourite so far. I think it has a nice atmosphere. It also has lots of characters in it, which is always fun to do. For some reason scenes with five or more characters usually turn out best. Perhaps there''s just more stuff happening.\\\" Is there anything you specifically like about working with Valheim? Is there anything that\\u2019s particularly challenging? \\\"Valheim is a very inspiring game. The beautiful landscape, the seemingly infinite number of things you can do, the mythological Norse setting - it all lends itself well to the sort of storytelling illustrations I like to do. The fact that it has a large and dedicated player base also gives me an extra push. The greatest challenge from my perspective is probably that Valheim isn''t a character-driven game. Who are the characters? They could be anyone.

May 28, 2024 Aside from the main crew at Iron Gate, Valheim also benefits from the contribution of some talented freelancers. We want to give them a chance to introduce themselves and their work, and for you to get to know them a bit better! You''ve already met lore writer Lee Williams and key artist Mats Minnhagen, and now it''s time to turn the spotlight on Samuel Fast and Philip Engstr\\u00f6m, the people behind Brikk Animation who create our fantastic animated trailers. What\\u2019s your background at Brikk ? Samuel (Founder & Creative Director): We are a studio driven by artists founded in 2010 by directors Bj\\u00f6rn Johansson, Josef Andersson and myself. The aim back then was (and still is) to create a passion-driven collective of artists and deliver the best 2D animated content in Sweden. In 2016, we pivoted towards our lifelong interest in games, and we never looked back. It\\u00b4s been a long journey, and we have had the pleasure of working with some of the most interesting game studios in the world, like Iron Gate. How did you, personally, get into making animation? Philip (Director): My interest in traditional animation grew in my late teens. I came across Japanese animation and realized that animation can be so much more than cartoons for kids. I was hooked. Back then it didn\\u2019t even cross my mind that you could work in animation, even less in something close to anime. After studying science for a while, I found myself spending more time making short films than studying. One thing led to another. I was shown the magic behind traditional animation, and my dream and goal became to make animation my profession. Samuel: In 2007, I started as an Illustrator and director, working with advertising and music videos. However, due to my background in illustration, I quickly pivoted towards animation due to my love of storytelling and characters. Back then, there was not much fun work in Sweden, so I mostly did infomercials for tech companies. Do you play a lot of Valheim yourselves to get inspiration?

Philip: I play whenever I get the chance, and lately, I''ve been playing more and more. I like the atmosphere in the game, but what inspires me the most is the immersiveness. The world feels somewhat familiar yet so scary. Every time I leave my base, I set out on a new adventure. The trailers we make for Valheim are basically how those adventures feel. Other inspirations are definitely my favorite anime series, especially the classic big sci-fi and fantasy animes that aim for a more adult audience like Akira, Ghost in the Shell, Mononoke, Berserk, everything from Satoshi Kon, Kawajiri, and the list goes on. I also tend to find a lot of inspiration for the animation craft in the real world. Animation is about translating motions into drawings on a timeline. It\\u2019s fascinating to analyze motions that you see around you. Everything from how it looks when water hits a cliff, people\\u2019s personalities in their walks, how light reflects on objects, and how motions blur looks. Oh, one more thing. Lord of the Rings! It\\u2019s objectively the best movie ever made, all categories. (Yes, I see the extended trilogy as one movie). Could you tell us a bit about your creative process? What does it look like from the idea stage to the finished work? Making animated trailers, like the ones we do for Valheim, requires a lot of man-hours and involves a lot of steps. Every frame of every character is drawn frame by frame. All backgrounds are custom artwork. We usually get a beautifully simple storyboard from Robin at Iron Gate. From that, we start with concept development and pre-production. We are a team of artists working together, and the result needs to be consistent and cohesive so it''s important that everyone has the same foundation before jumping into production. Most of the creativity happens during this pre-production phase. Next is the chunk of the project, the production. Here is when we know what to do and do it; one shot at a time. What animation that you have made for Valheim (so far) are you most proud of?

That\\u2019s the thing with working with Valheim, the ambition level always gets higher. Perhaps it\\u2019s our feeling, but we always want to push to make things bigger and more epic because the project deserves it! We want to challenge ourselves to come up with new ways of showing a scene. So with that, the answer is the newest one; the Ashlands trailer. For example, if you compare the amount of moving cameras and fight scenes in that trailer and the Hearth and Home trailer, the difficulty level is definitely up a few steps. Moving cameras are the coolest and hardest in traditional animation. Is there anything you specifically like about working with Valheim? Is there anything that\\u2019s particularly challenging? The world is great! I love the Scandinavian influence but with all the fantasy. (It\\u2019s the closest I\\u2019ve been to roam Middle Earth. Lord of the Rings is really good.) Viking environments usually tend to look like Iceland. I also like the trust and ambition level our teams Brikk and Iron Gate share. A big challenge with the characters in Valheim is the absence of pupils in their eyes. An easy way to add storytelling in animation can be done by subtle (and not so subtle) movement of the eyes. We\\u2019ve had to emphasize other motions to show what we want to convey which has worked out really well. Also it adds a small layer of uniqueness to the animation. Another thing that\\u2019s been a bit challenging is that the update we\\u2019re making a trailer for is in development when we do it. We work in parallel which means that we don\\u2019t know everything from the start. Sometimes cool things are developed by Iron Gate that we want to add or don\\u2019t have the time to add. If you were vikings, what would be your roles in a village? Philip: I''m definitely a fisherman, but I also wish I were the unexpected Viking warrior who could jump really high and long to surprise the enemy. Samuel: Due to my childhood interest in illusions and close-up magic, I would probably be a V\\u00f6lva.

PART V \\u2013 THE PLAINS BIOME (TIER 5) Welcome to the end-game Biome; the most dangerous place in Valheim: the Plains . The good news is we have a great large biome of the Plains just north of the Swamp where we fought Bonemass! But we need to build a dock for our boat so we can properly transport the next tier of ore: Blackmetal . Remember I talked about Healing Potions earlier? If you want to be as safe as possible, I recommend crafting some Healing potions and throwing them in your #8 slot for instant activation. Healing potions are generally a requirement if you\\u2019re playing Hardcore . I also want to mention that Valheim isn\\u2019t just about exploration, combat, and upgrading your equipment. It\\u2019s also about building amazing bases. If you haven\\u2019t upgraded your base yet, I recommend you do this. Rebuild it with stone, dig a moat, use reinforced iron beams to gain amazing height, and do whatever you need to protect it from events, because you can now experience raids of Fulings and other nasty creatures. Phase I \\u2013 Establishing a Foothold Plains Base Location Makes sure you have ample food , rest bonus and that it\\u2019s morning . Get that Honey ! Change your temp portal tag to PLAINS1 . Have materials to create a Portal. Take the BONEMASS portal.

\"Take the BONEMASS portal. Now head north. We\\u2019re going to run through the center of the big Plains biome just north of the Swamp. Mark any Fuling camps on your map but keep your distance . Pick up any Cloudberries you come across. Whack the Deathsquitos as they buzz close enough. They are glass cannons and will explode with one hit of your mace or one arrow strike. Once you get timing down, you\\u2019ll be able to whack them regularly without ever getting hit. You can also shoot them with a bow. Note that every Deathsquito drops a Needle , which is used to make the best arrows in the game. Farm them when you come across them. We aren\\u2019t farming Fulings yet, but if you encounter rogue Fulings, feel free to take them out, leveraging your parry blocking. They drop the Blackmetal Scrap you\\u2019re looking for. Lox are the giant furry cow-like critters that wander around. Be careful though, they hit like a truck. Shoot them at a distance and when they come to you, use your Frostner and Iron Shield to beat them down. They drop Lox Meat and Lox Hide , which unlocks the Lox Cape , and Lox Rug . 2-star Fulings cannot be parried! Plus they can 1-shot you. If you come across a 2-star Fuling at this point, just run. You can try to kite with your bow, but if they get one lucky hit in, it could be the one hit that kills you. Run to the north end of the Plains until you encounter the ocean, then find a place that\\u2019s in the Plains right on the edge of the Black Forest. Make sure the base is in the Plains. Clear the area, build your workbench and Portal and name it PLAINS1 . Build a storage chest and put any Darkmetal Ore you acquired into it. Mark it on your map as PLAINS1 . Go back to your base! Rest , stock up on food , etc. Ready to get 17 Comfort?

Lox rug takes 4 Lox Pelt, and the Hearth requires a StoneCutter ( 10 Wood, 2 Iron, 4 Stone ) in proximity to build the Hearth ( 15 stone ). You should now be at 17 Comfort (24 minutes) . Feel free to craft some Needle Arrows and switch over to those if you have more than 40, but make sure you have at least 100 arrows on you (Obsidian as backup). Phase II \\u2013 Hunting Fulings, Blackmetal, Barley and Flax Now it\\u2019s time to go hunting! Remember those Fuling encampments we came across? Time to shoot them like fish in a bucket. Always keep your food up in the plains (at least 150 health) Make sure it\\u2019s MORNING and you have full rest bonus . Go to your Cauldron and craft a Fire Resistance Mead . Just one. Ferment it . This will be for our final boss fight later on. Make sure you have full food and at least 100 Obsidian or Needle arrows. Make sure all equipment is repaired . Go to your PLAINS1 portal and head south for the closest Fuling camp! Not the stone tower, but the camp with the bonfires. Get to a high point on the ground that\\u2019s quite a distance and start picking off the Fulings. Take out the Shamen first, followed by the little guys who aren\\u2019t running around crazed because they don\\u2019t know where the shots came from. When you\\u2019ve cleared the camp, head in and loot everything. You should find Barley in the chests and a Totem . Note you need 5 totems to summon the final boss, so save it. You\\u2019ll also find Barley growing in 4 fields. Loot all of it. This is our foundation for making Flour . Get me some of that Juicy Barley! Unfortunately, this base has no Flax , which is our other needed material. We\\u2019ll need to raid another camp for that. Once you kill all of the Fulings at camp, it doesn\\u2019t respawn.

Run back to your portal camp and put the Blackmetal Scrap , Barley and Totems in the chest. Now hit the Camp to the East, Southeast of your camp. They have Flax . Take it slow as there are multiple Fuling Berserkers . You should have more than 40 Flax after you loot everything. We now have everything we need to start our Plains Farm! There\\u2019s a reason we chose a spot next to the Black Forest . Farm 100 Wood . Clear a big space around your portal (putting your portal and storage box on the edge). Make it big (think 200\\u2032 x 200\\u2032). Surround it with Stakewalls (no door). Note this doesn\\u2019t stop Deathsquitos , but it will stop aggro from Lox and Fulings (because they can\\u2019t see you). I put a ladder over each side of the wall so I don\\u2019t need a door. Make sure none of your \\u201cfield\\u201d is in Black Forest! We\\u2019re pretty close to it. Go back to your base and craft a Cultivator at the Forge ( 5 Core Wood, 5 Bronze ). Throw it in your #8 slot. I don\\u2019t upgrade the Cultivator because I\\u2019m never using it away from a portal or base. Keep a corner of the enclosed area clear (portal, etc.) for a place we\\u2019ll build our Windmills (2 of them). It\\u2019s Farming Time! Watch out for Deathsquitos! Port back to your new enclosed area and cultivate all of that soil! Make it black and rich! Grab all of the Flax out of your chest and plant all of it. You can plant them very close together. I recommend rows. We want to harvest a total of 100 Flax , and whatever you plant will double the yield. We want to do Flax first because that helps us make the best end-game armor. Next, plant the Barley . Fill the rest of the entire space if you can. When you plant 1 of something, 2 can be harvested.

we can multiply our farms.

Once we spool 100 Flax , we\\u2019re done for now (unless you want to build more end-game gear for friends, or create other weapons to try out, etc.). Once the Barley crop is done, plant as much as will fit in the area and start processing the rest.

By the time you\\u2019re done, you\\u2019ll live in the Plains, facetank Lox and laugh at Deathsquitos. The only thing that\\u2019ll be really dangerous to you is a 2-star Fuling. One of the fun things about building a base right on the edge of Plains and another biome is the creatures from the two biomes will always be fighting each other. This is a good source of free resources. When we smelt Blackmetal for the first time, the Blackmetal shields are unlocked, and when we create Linen Thread for the first time, it unlocks Blackmetal weapons and the end-game Padded Armor. Spoiler alert: you\\u2019ll probably have to farm more Iron Ore! Good thing we have a swamp with a ton of crypts still waiting to be excavated. For this next phase we\\u2019ll need 100 Blackmetal, 146 Iron, and 100 Linen Thread. You\\u2019ll also need 11 chain from the Swamp to make your Blackmetal Shield. Now we can make everything +4 except for the Blackmetal shield, which currently has a max upgrade level of +3. Make sure you have crafted the Grinding Wheel upgrade for your Forge . If you haven\\u2019t done this yet, craft a Stonecutter , then a Sharpening Stone . This unlocks the Grinding Wheel . Now craft that by your Forge and you\\u2019ll be Level 7! Talk about packed!

\"Build an Artisan\\u2019s Workbench , and then build two Windmills within your walls. Make sure you have access to the intake and outflow ports. Now load them up with as much extra Barley that isn\\u2019t planted and growing. Picking up Barley Flour will unlock Bread , Lox Meat Pie and Blood Pudding . Fun fact! If you use the spinning (middle-mouse) attack of the Atgeir on Barley or Flax, you will get 4x the amount rather than 2x! I guess it doubles as a farming scythe! Grind that Barley! Now go back to your base and build a Spinning Wheel ( 20 Fine Wood, 10 Iron Nails, 5 Leather Scraps ). I put mine near my forge. Upgrade your workbench by crafting a Toolshelf ( 4 Iron, 10 Fine Wood, 4 Obsidian ). Next, craft a Blast Furnace ( 20 Stone, 5 Surtling Core, 10 Iron, 20 Fine Wood ) behind your two Smelters. You are now ready to process all the materials you\\u2019re going to get from the plains. You probably already have quite a bit of Blackmetal Scrap that you\\u2019ve collected in the chest back at your PLAINS1 base. If you\\u2019re still waiting for your Flax and Barley to be ready for harvest, go raid a nearby Fuling camp and get more Blackmetal Scrap. Don\\u2019t forget to kill Lox for their hides and Deathsquitos for their needles. I recommend going to the other camp to the south that has Flax because you can plan that and the yield from two crops will be more than the 100 you need. After you make 100 Flax you don\\u2019t really need it anymore, but I would keep some around in case you need to grow more in the future. You can tell Flax and Barley are ready for harvesting when they turn golden in color. When you\\u2019ve collected 4 stacks of 30 Blackmetal Scrap (it\\u2019s more than we need, but it\\u2019s good to have a bit extra), it\\u2019s time to sail that juicy goodness back to your base!

know what to do! Get the nails and all the other parts necessary to build a ship from your base, take them through the PLAINS1 portal, build the Karve in the water, and move the ore one stack at a time from your mini-base storage to your ship. Sail it all home! You can change up the order of the below items based on having Chain or not. If you need more Chain, either go to the Swamp at night and hunt Wraiths, or go into Crypts and loot them from the chests. For the final end-game weapons and armor , we need: 100 Blackmetal, 146 Iron, 100 Linen Thread, 11 Chain, 18 Lox Pet, 2 Silver, 45 Fine Wood, and 17 Needle . If you have all of this, you\\u2019re golden. If not, craft what you can and upgrade what you can when you can. First, let\\u2019s craft and upgrade the best end-game mace; The Porcupine ( 5 Fine Wood, 32 Iron, 17 Needle, 10 Linen Thread ). Put Frostner in Storage. You\\u2019ll be using it again! Next make and fully upgrade: Padded Cuirass ( 28 Iron, 20 Thread ), Padded Greaves ( 28 Iron, 20 Thread ), Padded Helmet ( 40 Iron, 15 Thread ), and Lox Cape ( 18 Lox Pelt, 2 Silver ). Note we stick with the Lox cape and don\\u2019t get a Linen Cape (even though it looks cooler) because the Lox cape has cold resistance, but the Linen Cape does not . Time to make and upgrade the best woodcutter in the game, the Blackmetal Axe ( 80 Blackmetal, 6 Fine Wood, 35 Linen ) And time to make and upgrade the best shield in the game, the Blackmetal Shield ( 40 Fine Wood, 20 Blackmetal, 11 Chain ). While the Serpent shield looks cooler, it doesn\\u2019t have Parry, which makes it very poor for fighting tough monsters. When you\\u2019re done with all of this, you are equipment complete. Congratulations!

Phase IV \\u2013 Fishing & Fish Tacos It\\u2019s time to fish and make Fish Tacos ! Lox Meat Pie + Blood Pudding + Fish Tacos = 255 health. Below is a video that shows how we fish in Valheim. Go to the Trader and buy a Fishing Pole (350 coins) and 2 Fishing Bait (20 coins). Go back to your base and start fishing! Capture around 10 fish. Go and make 10x Fish Tacos , 10x Lox Mat Pie , and 10x Blood Pudding . You now have the best food combination in the game, and are ready for the final boss! Phase V \\u2013 Yagluth We\\u2019re nearly at the end of the game. It\\u2019s finally time to take on the Plains Boss, Yagluth . His spawn point is just south of our PLAINS1 base. Make sure you are loaded on Food (Fish Tacos + Lox Meat Pie + Blood Pudding), rested , it\\u2019s morning, etc. Get that Fire Resistance potion from the Fermenter ! Get Frostner out of storage. It\\u2019s the best weapon against him since he\\u2019s undead. Grab your 5 Totems and head to the Summoning Altar for Yagluth . Activate your Fire Resistance Potion . Summon him! He has 3 attacks: the meteors (which he raises his hand for and calls out), the beam of death, and the explosion. You need to dodge the meteors and beam of death, but the explosion isn\\u2019t a problem. You\\u2019re going to melee him; don\\u2019t worry about blocking with your shield. Just whack the hell out of him and run when he does his meteors or beam of death. He\\u2019s quite easy once you get the cadence down. Once he\\u2019s dead, take his head and the Yagluth Things that drop (they currently do nothing, but when the next major update comes out, they should convert to whatever they are used for). Go back to base, take portal to ALTAR , and mount Yagluth\\u2019s head! Congratulations!

\"Congratulations! You have defeated all of the bosses currently available in the game! Now you can get down and dirty with what you\\u2019re really supposed to do\\u2026 BASE BUILDING! But before we do that, there\\u2019s one more thing. PART VI \\u2013 SERPENT HUNTING Now that we\\u2019ve completed all of the bosses, it\\u2019s time to go Serpent Hunting! Remember that floating Kraken when we sailed to the first swamp? We\\u2019re going back, and we\\u2019re going to mine the Chitin from its back to make a Harpoon. Here\\u2019s a video of how to solo hunt Serpents. Remember that Kraken we saw on our way to Bonemass ? Head back there, jump on his back and Collect at least 30 Chitin . Don\\u2019t worry, the Kraken won\\u2019t start submerging until the third rumble, and even then, you have plenty of time to mine 30 or more. Also, he won\\u2019t attack you, he just submerges. Make sure you have enough stamina to swim back to your boat if you don\\u2019t make it in time! Head back to your base and craft the Abyssal Harpoon . Test it on the local wildlife! Deer are the most fun, but Greylings work as well. Next, wait for a storm (or at least rain). During the day is ok, but nighttime is best. Head on out to the Ocean , which is just outside your base. You should encounter a Serpent in no time. Perhaps even two. Focus on one. Eat the 3 big foods to get the maximum amount of Stamina you can. Harpoon the Serpent and pull him in per the video and end his ugly existence! Pick up the goodies to unlock the Serpent Scale Shield . While it\\u2019s the best looking shield in the game, it lacks Parry, which makes it useless to us. But we\\u2019re going to craft it and hang it on our wall anyway! Cook the Serpent Meat to unlock Serpent Stew ! Some players even drag the Serpent into an enclosed water area next to their base to trap it as a pet! Just don\\u2019t try to pet it. In the end, our home base only needs two portals.

You can access it here . Welcome to the The Complete Valheim Written Guide ! Whether you are a new or experienced player, this guide will show you step by step how to have one of the best starts in the game. This includes: progressing the player through each Biome, defeating all of the bosses, learning combat & core mechanics, cooking, building, farming, harvesting, and even hunting sea serpents. We also build roads, use carts to transport ore, set up a portal network, sail between islands, and craft the best equipment in the game. This guide is also Hardcore viable . It specifically focuses on maximizing defensive and offensive equipment prior to progressing to the next biome. First, this guide is quite large; but so is the game. The size of this guide is an indication of how many great features and the sheer volume of content Valheim has to offer.

\"03.22.2021 ADDITIONAL ADJUSTMENTS Added a few new tips and made additional adjustments and corrections. 03.14.2021 MINOR ADJUSTMENTS Many minor adjustments correcting some typos, values, and other minor errors. 03.07.2021 INITIAL RELEASE While the core guide is complete, I will continue to make adjustments to the content, updating links and refining the guide. If you see any errors or have recommendations, please leave a comment! One of the key reasons I built this written guide is while there are numerous videos online that are solid guides to certain features, mechanics or boss fights. The reality is the game is so large, it would be near impossible to make an instructional video guide covering all content that people could watch from beginning to end. This guide includes every step necessary to get from starting the game to building a base and living in the Plains with the best gear currently available, all while exploring every feature Valheim has to offer . There is a lot of content, but if followed in order, I believe readers will quickly find the steps to be clear, highly efficient and effective. Once the guide is complete, there is also an End Game section for readers to review and follow. Each section has been defined by Part, Phase and Number. This way, you can quickly mark where you left off and return at any time. There is also a detailed Table of Contents below, which has active links to each section of the guide. DISCLAIMER! This guide uses a static world seed . I highly recommend players use this seed; not just because it\\u2019s a great world layout, but because the guide revolves around learning the game based on the provided world, biomes and locations. By using this seed, everything in this guide will be in the exact same place for you as it was for me. Also, as this guide progresses, it does less handholding . Here is the World the seed generates. As you can see, everything we need is in close proximity! For Experienced Players : There is content within this guide that will be very useful to those who aren\\u2019t starting a new game. Check out the Table of Contents below and browse the materials to see if anything jumps out at you.

\"Part VII has detailed information on end-game play and farming techniques. For New Players : Valheim is a very large and complex sandbox survival and exploration game. Even with this guide, the game may seem overwhelming because there is so much to do and understand. Don\\u2019t worry; everyone goes through this process. It takes a few days to really start understanding the mechanics, interface and overall breadth of what the game has to offer. It\\u2019ll all be worth it in the end. Color Coding : I tried to streamline the colors in this guide. Green is for information . Light Blue is for resource reference . Red is for important/alert information or enemy definition . Purple is for item reference. Dark Blue is for location tags . Orange is for action references . New Players : I recommend watching these two videos before you start.

camp, getting Leather Armor, a Crude Bow, and preparing to venture into the Black Forest. New players will also learn the core mechanics, basic building, and basic combat. Phase I \\u2013 Establishing your Starting Base Create your character. If you plan on following the recommended guide map, you will need to create a new world. I called it \\u201cGuideWorld\\u201d. Use the seed of dvFDqtV7D9 . Make sure you entered every character properly, or you will have a completely different world! Once the world is created, press Start. Before we begin, many experienced players disable the visuals for ground Vegetation when starting a new game. This makes resources on the ground (Rocks, Sticks, Mushrooms, etc.) much easier to spot. If you wish to do this, go to: Game Menu > Settings > Graphics (Tab) > Set Vegetation Quality to LOW . Players generally turn it back on when they move to the Black Forest (second) Biome. Talk to Hugin (Press E). Approach the red runestone that says \\u201cVegvisir Eikthyr\\u201d and press E. This will reveal the spawn location of the first boss. You don\\u2019t have to worry about that for now, it was just marked on the map. Talk to Hugin again .

You can middle-click the location on the map and it will show in-game, allowing you to quickly know what direction to head! As you run, gather all of the Wood, Stone, Berries, and Mushrooms you come across (by pressing E). Punch small bushes (left-click) and trees to obtain wood and raise your unarmed skill. Also, punch any Greylings or Boars you come across. Your character will automatically pick up the items they drop once they \\u201cexplode\\u201d. You can ignore Deer (you won\\u2019t be able to catch/kill them yet). You\\u2019ll notice the yellow \\u201cStamina\\u201d bar at the bottom as you Run, punch trees, Greylings, and Boars. Learn to manage your stamina because it\\u2019s a key mechanic to playing the game and engaging in combat. Once you\\u2019ve gathered 5 wood and 4 stone , press Tab, select Stone Axe and Craft. This should go in your #2 hotbar slot. Press #2 to equip the axe. Talk to Hugin as he appears. Keep heading towards the pond and pick up every stone you see and cut down all of the small trees and bushes you come across. Ignore large trees for now. Kill all of the Boars you see and collect their Leather Scraps . Keep heading South, Southwest (checking your map to ensure you\\u2019re going the right direction) until you reach the clearing and pond defined on the guide map (and seen below). We\\u2019re going to build on the north side of the pond. Our Starting Base Location! Perfect! Talk to Hugin anytime he appears. Once you arrive at the location shown in the guide map picture, press TAB, select hammer and click Craft. This will unlock Workbench, Campfire , and Cooking Station and put the hammer in your #3 slot. ( 3 Wood, 2 Stone ) Continue to gather wood and stone. You\\u2019ll need 5 stone and 22 wood for the next step.

Find a flat spot on the north side of the pond to build our first camp and press 3 (select your Hammer ). Right click to bring up the hammer build menu, and click on the Crafting tab. Now click on Workbench and place it on the flat ground. This will cause a ton of items to flash across the screen because it unlocks building mode.

Next we need to enclose the Workbench so we can use it to craft (it must be sheltered to actually use). To do this, we\\u2019re going to construct 4 surrounding walls and 2 \\u201croof\\u201d pieces. To do this, select your Hammer (by pressing 3), right-click, select the Building tab, and the Wood Wall (4th) selection. Start by placing 2 walls behind the workbench as seen in the below photo. ( 4 wood ) Next put a wall on each edge, as seen below. Use the middle mouse scroll wheel to rotate the pieces accordingly. Next select either 26\\u00b0 or 45\\u00b0 thatch roof and place two roof pieces over each section as seen below. You now have your first functional Workbench ! Congratulations! The first thing we\\u2019re going to do is repair our items. To do this, select the Workbench (E) and click on the hammer icon hanging from the left of the Interface. Keep doing this until it becomes greyed out. Next we\\u2019re going to mark the map. To do this, press M and use the mouse wheel to scroll in. Left click on the white house icon in the lower left and then double click on your cursor. This will place the icon on the map at your location. Type in \\u201c Starting Base \\u201d and press enter. The map is now marked so it will be easy for you to return to your base if you run too far away gathering resources for the next step.

the little hanging hammer icon on the left? That\\u2019s the Repair icon. It will auto-repair any items that can be repaired at that station by clicking on it. The general rule of thumb is when it\\u2019s available to click, just keep clicking it to repair everything in your inventory until it\\u2019s disabled. Repairing your gear doesn\\u2019t cost anything. Before we can build our first structure, we need to gather more resources. We need 5 stone and 60 wood . Remember you can return to your workbench at any time to repair your axe if the durability gets too low. Cutting down and up an entire Beech tree gives 20 wood. Ignore the white (Birch) trees. Those are for cutting down later with a Bronze axe. You will get a \\u201ctoo hard\\u201d message with your current axe. Once you\\u2019ve gotten 5 stone and 60 wood , head back to your workstation. Select it and craft a Hoe . To do this click on Hoe in the Workbench craft menu and craft it ( 5 wood, 2 stone ). This will put it in your #4 slot and unlock a collection of actions such as clear ground. Now it\\u2019s time to clear the ground to build our first camp. Select the Hoe (4). By default, Level Ground is selected. This is what we want. Turn around, and clear a good section of land next to the Workbench. The hoe levels the ground to the level of your feet. Use it in a circular fashion around you to get the best results. If the ground won\\u2019t level, it\\u2019s too high or too low \\u2013 focus on ground that\\u2019s similar in level and keep hitting it. If it starts getting dark while you\\u2019re out gathering resources, you can equip your torch to see better! Try to get the ground looking similar to the picture below. Now we\\u2019re going to build a very small house that contains only a fire and bed.

( 30 wood ) Next, right-click, select the Misc tab, select Campfire , and place it where the 9th floor piece would be. ( 5 stone ) Now place a doorway in the corner of our structure on the opposite side of the fire by right-clicking (while the Hammer is active) and selecting Building and the Wood Door piece. Use the mouse wheel to rotate it properly. Note as you try to position the door, it will allow you to snap on the outside, inside, or center. Make sure you snap to the center. ( 2 Wood ) REMEMBER! You can middle-mouse click any building object to destroy it and recover materials; this is very useful if you accidentally placed an item in the wrong place or at the wrong angle. Now surround the structure with 15 Walls . ( 30 wood ) Next we\\u2019re going to install vertical Wood pole 1m (the shorter ones) posts in each corner and one in between each corner. ( 8 wood ) You might have to jump on the roof of the Workbench or get on a slope to position all 4 posts. If that doesn\\u2019t work, simply construct a Wood Ladder in the right location, climb up on it, and finish the post positions. If the \\u201cyou could eat another bite\\u201d message comes up, eat another berry or mushroom to keep your stamina regeneration up. Next we\\u2019re going to install the horizontal beam structures to connect the four corners. This will serve as the connection points for our roof. Select the horizontal Wood beam 2m and start connecting the four posts, rotating the pieces with the mouse wheel for each side. ( 32 wood ) Time for the Roof! We\\u2019re going to use the Thatch Roof 26\\u00b0 as seen below. Each side takes 4 pieces. To properly align the pieces from one side to another, simply rotate them 180\\u2032 with the middle mouse wheel. Note the easiest angle to place the roof pieces is from underneath (as seen below).

32 wood ) We\\u2019re almost done! Now we need to place a bed. With your hammer active, select the Furniture tab and click on Bed . Place it next to the fire in the middle of the building. Our first little house is almost complete! You can set the bed as a spawn point by selecting it (E). You should now have a Rested buff of 11 minutes! This makes a huge difference and prepares us for the next stage! This house design allows the smoke from the fire to escape without killing you, but to make it more efficient in discarding the smoke, we just change the one roof tile over the fire and angle it upward. To do this, craft a ladder to get on the roof, walk next to the tile you\\u2019re going to replace (that\\u2019s over the fire). Make sure you aren\\u2019t on top of it. Have your cursor over the tile and hit the middle mouse button to destroy it. Now select the Thatch Roof 26\\u00b0 , rotate it accordingly and place it to meet the below image. This keeps the fire covered (if it\\u2019s not covered and it rains, the fire will be put out) and allows the smoke to escape more efficiently. The final step before we begin the next phase is to build 3 cooking stations over our fire for cooking the meat we\\u2019re going to farm. To do this, with the Hammer active, select the Crafting tab and Cooking Station , and place 3 of them over the fire as seen below. ( 6 wood ) If it is almost night time, or the middle of the night, Sleep in your bed by first claiming it (E) and then selecting it again. NOTE: I recommend keeping all of the Tree Seeds you find so you can replant the forests you cut down later on! Phase II \\u2013 Hunting and crafting Weapons and Armor Repair everything! Time to make a Flint Axe . See the little pond next to your base? Run around and pick up all the Flint . There\\u2019s also some you can get by swimming a bit. While doing this, kill any Neck lizards that you see to get their Neck Tail meat.

(4 wood, 6 flint) Replace your Stone Axe (Slot #2) with the Flint Axe by pressing tab and dragging slot 5 to slot 2. Time to toss the Stone Axe. To get rid of it, run out of the distance of your Workbench, click on it in your inventory and then click anywhere on the screen that\\u2019s not part of the UI. This will cause your character to toss it. The reason we do this away from your workbench is so it will despawn. If you toss the item in proximity of your workbench, it will stay around as long as the workbench is around. This is how you get rid of items in your inventory. Did you kill some neck and get Neck Tail ? If so, go into your house and cook the meat by repeatedly pressing E while the cooking stations are selected. The meat will be tossed over the fire and you need to wait until you hear the \\u201csizzle\\u201d sound (and you\\u2019ll see it visually change). once this happens, press E again (one time for each piece) to take it off the station and gather it. Once you\\u2019ve got the Grilled Neck Tail , eat a piece. It\\u2019s possible an event will take place where boars and necks come out of the woodwords, and it says \\u201cEikthyr rallies the creatures of the forest\\u201d. If this happens, simply run around and kill the boars and neck and take their meat and hide! It\\u2019s time to hunt! Our target? Boar . They\\u2019re all around us in the clearings and forest, so they won\\u2019t be hard to find. Slash them down with your handy Flint Axe and gather their Leather Scraps and Meat . As you explore, you will come across abandoned buildings. Many of them have chests that contain useful resources. Be sure to loot these! You can also construct a workstation and break them down (with middle mouse button) to obtain additional resources.

\"Once you have at least 8 Leather Scraps , head back to camp. make sure you have at least 26 wood . If not, cut down trees with your handy Flint Axe. Craft a Crude Bow ( 10 wood, 8 leather scraps ) and 60 Wooden Arrows ( 24 wood ). Press TAB to open your inventory and right-click on the wooden arrows to equip them. Don\\u2019t forget to Repair ! Let\\u2019s arrange our hotbar items really quick. Put Bow in #1, Axe in #2, Torch in #3, Hammer in #4 and Hoe in #5 . Make sure your Rest Bonus is active! If your fire needs wood, be sure to put it on. Have raw meat? Cook it over the fire! Build a Chest in the corner of your house for storage. ( 10 wood ) I recommend putting stone, trophies and extra flint in there. If it\\u2019s close to night time, Sleep . When ready, Equip your bow. Note the beginning Crude Bow has terrible falloff for its arrows, so it takes a bit of time to adjust to. To properly fire the bow, hold down the left mouse button and aim above your target depending on distance. Release only when the circle is as small as it can get. Make sure you have sufficient stamina to do this, as running out will cancel your draw. Note you can right-click while drawing to cancel your bow release without losing an arrow. Our next goal is to Upgrade our Workbench . To do this, we need 25 flint, 20 Leather Scraps, 20 Wood and 23 Deer hide . You should be eating Grilled Neck + Cooked Meat + Berries by now, for a total of 95 health. The first thing we need to get is the Flint . To do this, we head to the ocean shore, Southwest of our base. You should be able to gather 25 flint in just a few minutes. When you\\u2019re done, run back to your base and renew your rest bonus. Make sure you have at least 40 arrows . If not, cut down a tree and craft them. Warning!

below image shows a small patch of Black Forest by the ocean near our base. This is just a \\u201csliver\\u201d of terrain (this happens often during world generation), but you can see it\\u2019s very different from the Meadows by the trees. Tougher monsters will spawn here, and my friend even had a Troll spawn here in his first playthrough of this map (as he was running around in a loincloth gathering wood). Be cautious whenever you see these trees and stay away from any Fir/Pine style trees this early in the game. I recommend staying away from these trees for now (Black Forest Biome) Put any extra items like Resin or stacks of meat greater than 5 into your Chest . You can split items by holding down Shift and clicking on them. Now, we are going to learn how to Hunt Deer . The best way to properly hunt deer is to use sneak, and the best way to increase our Sneak skill is to do it around either Neck or Boar . We have Neck right next to our base, and Wild Boar are all around in the clearings. Plus it\\u2019s always good to get Neck Tail Meat and Leather Scraps , which we do need to upgrade our workbench. Find a few Neck and/or Boar that are fairly close and press Ctrl to enter Sneak mode. Sneak back and forth at a distance, and you should see your skill increasing. You can tell how effective your sneak is by the size of the eye; when it\\u2019s a straight line, you can\\u2019t be seen. When it\\u2019s open, you\\u2019ve been seen. As your stamina is approaches 0 simply stand still and wait for it to refresh (while still being in sneak mode). Do this a few times and you\\u2019ll quickly get to level 10. Once you\\u2019re level 10, take out the neck/boar and we\\u2019re almost ready! Shoot birds when you can to gather feathers! It\\u2019s best to hunt birds at night or during storms as they tend to stay on the ground more often. Before we hunt deer, if you run east from your base, you will see a small shack (below). Within this shack is a bee hive. Don\\u2019t go inside or they will sting you.

safely shoot down the hive, shoot from the angle seen below. Once it\\u2019s shot, go inside and you will get both Honey and a Queen Bee . Don\\u2019t eat the Honey! Save it! We\\u2019ll build a Beehive when we return to our base from hunting. Get that Queen Bee! Whenever I come across an abandoned house, I dismantle it. I place a workbench next to it and use the right mouse button to tear it down, gather the resources, and then take down my workbench. This is a great way to get wood. Make sure you read any runestones you come across! Listen for Deer . They make a distinct sound. Some may be in clearings, and others may be in the woods. When you hear them, enter sneak mode and head in the direction of the sound. When you\\u2019re ready, make sure you have enough stamina to pull your bow and shoot an arrow properly. It\\u2019s also important to note Wind is a factor; if you are up wind from deer, even in sneak mode, you\\u2019ll spook them. So try to always be downwind from any deer you\\u2019re hunting! You can tell the direction of the wind by the wispy lines that appear on the screen. If you see a deer with antlers that\\u2019s a 1 or 2-star deer, and it will give more meat and hide! Our goal is to get 2 Deer Trophies and 5 Deer Hide . You could get this with just 2 deer, or it may take 4 or 5. Once you have 2 Deer Trophies and 5 Deer Hide , we need to focus on getting the 20 leather scraps . Hunt boars (and raise sneak if you want) to do this. Another thing you can practice is Sneak Attacking . Sneak up behind a boar and whack it. Want to run faster? Press R to sheathe your weapon. When you\\u2019re ready to take it out, press R again! Also works with 1H Weapon/Shield. You may need to return to your base to make more arrows or renew your rest bonus, or sleep when nightfall comes.

\"Want to get rid of Wet without waiting for it to countdown? Just jump in and out of a fire! Once you have 25 flint, 20 Leather Scraps, 20 Wood and 23 Deer hide , head back to your base and level the terrain around your workshop with the hoe to prepare for placing your two upgrades. Use your hammer and craft a Tanning Rack and Chopping Block . Note you will want to place these next to the Workbench. I recommend putting one on either side. The Tanning Rack unlocks Leather Armor (Chest, Legs, and Helmet), and Fire Arrows . The Chopping Block just raises the Workbench Level from 2 (from the Tanning Rack) to 3. Now, craft Leather Tunic, Leather Pants and a Leather Helmet ( 18 Deer Hide ). Equip them and we should have 6 armor! It\\u2019s a good start! Remember that Queen Bee we got? Time to make a Beehive ! You can craft it under the Crafting menu. I recommend putting it a bit of a distance from the Workbench. You can now farm Honey from the beehive, up to 4 every 2 days, and you can create multiple hives based on the extra queens you find as you adventure through the meadows. Note Honey is the key ingredient in crafting potions! Phase III \\u2013 Upgrading Weapons and Killing the First Boss Now it\\u2019s time to upgrade our Flint Axe, Crude Bow , and craft a Wooden Shield (and upgrade that) so we can prepare to explore the Black Forest . First we need to learn how to use an Axe and Shield, so we need to gather 10 wood, 4 resin and 4 leather scraps . After that, we\\u2019re going to upgrade our Crude bow to +2 , which takes 5 wood, 4 leather scraps and 1 deer hide , and finally we\\u2019ll upgrade our Flint Axe to +2 , which takes 3 flint and 2 leather scraps . Hunt for Birds while you\\u2019re out \\u2013 we\\u2019re going to need at least 10 feathers!

\"Hunt any dear you come across, try to sneak attack boars, and work on refining your combat techniques. We need a total of 9 Flint, 26 Leather Scrap, and 25 Wood . When you\\u2019ve gathered these resources, upgrade your Flint Axe and Crude Bow and craft and upgrade a Wooden Shield. When you craft your shield, put it in slot #3. You can toss your torch (don\\u2019t need it). Now is the time to start learning how to block damage with a Shield. Try it with Greylings and Boars. Equip your Axe and Shield (2 & 3) and right-click to block. You parry (cause the target to stagger and do extra damage) if you synchronize your block in the middle of their attack. Learn to properly block and parry! We\\u2019re about ready to go after the first boss! To do this, we want to craft 60 Fire Arrows ( 24 Wood, 24 Resin, 6 Feathers ). When crafted, right-click the arrows in your inventory to equip them. Make sure you have 2 Deer Trophies in your inventory. Also make sure you have 2 Cooked Meat, 2 Neck Tail and 4 Berries . Repair your gear, and sleep if it\\u2019s evening. Time to head to the first boss! Press M to bring up the map, and you should see the marking for Eikthyr to the west of your starting point. If you want to see where this is in-game, hover over the point, press the middle mouse button and press M to see the point in-game. Head to the Altar of Eikthyr ! On your way there don\\u2019t waste your Fire Arrows on any targets; we need them for the boss. When you get to the Altar, make sure you eat Cooked Meat + Neck Tail + Berries . Then place the 2 Deer Trophies in your #8 hotbar, highlight the Altar and press 8 to summon the boss . The fight is very easy with Fire Arrows . You just Kite him . Get behind the stones when he reers up to do his electrical attack.

When he\\u2019s dead, run over his body to pick up his head (a trophy). Make sure you have room in your inventory. Now we run to the place we started the game at; the boss trophy altar. It\\u2019s just to the east of the Eikthyr fight. When you get there, walk up to the stone that has the image of the deer on it, mouse over the hook and select Attach Item to the Trophy Hook . Next, while you have the stone highlighted, press E to activate Eikthyr\\u2019s power . You now have the Power of Eikthyr selected in the lower left. To activate this power (don\\u2019t do it yet!) press F. It\\u2019s a 20 minute cooldown, and the power lasts for 4 minutes. It\\u2019s time to run back to our Starting Base. When you get there, go to your Workstation, Repair all, and craft the Antler Pickaxe . Put it in your #6 slot. Sleep , because tomorrow is a big day and we need the entire day to do what\\u2019s next! PART II \\u2013 THE BLACK FOREST BIOME (TIER 2) What we\\u2019ll accomplish: Start our new Main Base, Explore the Black Forest , Gather Surtling Cores , Mine Copper Ore , Smelt Ore, Make Bronze Weapons and Armor , and upgrade our gear! This is where the game starts to get challenging, and we encounter the first true nemesis of every player \\u2013 the Troll . This guide actually does not focus on killing trolls and using their armor; but you are welcome to if you would like. The only issue is if you kill just one troll after the Elder , \\u201cThe Ground is Shaking\\u201d event unlocks and can be triggered any time. It\\u2019s the most devastating attack at the beginning of the game because two trolls can obliterate your base. I kite the Trolls and pull them away from my base. That\\u2019s the best way to handle it until you can tank them with maxed Bronze Weapons and Shield. So for the most part, I ignore trolls until I have full Bronze Gear and Armor.

Phase I \\u2013 Running to and Starting our New Main Base It\\u2019s time to leave our beloved Starting Base and move to the location where we are going to build our main base. The first thing we\\u2019re going to do is take the important resources we need to rebuild what we have at our new location. Just a heads up; you are going to leave a number of items behind. Don\\u2019t worry. Items you are going to leave behind (in the Chest): Trophies, Seeds, Uncooked Meat (more than 20), Stone (more than 5) . What you are taking : Deer Hide, Leather Scraps, Resin, Arrows , Feathers, Berries/Cooked Food, Greydwarf Eyes, Queen Bee, Honey, Hard Antler, Uncooked Meat (only up to 20), Stone (only 5) . Repair your gear! Now we\\u2019re going to break down our Beehive, Chopping Block, Tanning Rack and Workbench (equip your hammer and use the middle mouse button to destroy them). Don\\u2019t worry about the enclosure around the workbench. Make sure you pick everything up. You should have 25 flint, 40 wood and one queen bee from dismantling the rack, block, hive, and workbench. Your weight should be under 300 (~250). If it\\u2019s above 300, you may have too much stone or something else not in the list. The Black Forest is very dangerous because it\\u2019s the first Biome where the player can be attacked not only by groups of tough monsters, but Trolls as well; and a Troll will generally 1-shot your character at this point. Ready to run through the Black Forest ? We\\u2019re going to use the power of Eikthyr to make the journey as quick as possible! Press F and follow the route on the map below. You\\u2019ll hug the eastern side of the island, running south along the ocean once you come across it. Mark Copper deposits on your map as you run! You can identify Copper Deposits by the golden veins that are on the surface. Pick up Thistle and Blueberries ! Run away from Trolls!

Now build the Chopping Block and Tanning Rack as you had it at your previous base. You can put the Beehive down as well. As you can see, we have rocks in the way. Well, we have a pick now! Select the Pickaxe (#6) and get rid of those rocks ! Make sure you don\\u2019t accidentally pick into the ground, which will \\u201cmine\\u201d the ground and lower the level. If you accidentally do this, switch to your hoe and try to level it back. If you can\\u2019t, you can select the Hoe, right-click and select the Raise Ground option, and raise the ground to where you need it to be. Clear the area so we can put the foundation for our new home down! We need a total of 322 Wood and 8 Stone to build our home. You can either go out and gather all of the wood at once and pile it at the build site, or gather, then build, then gather again, then build some more. It\\u2019s up to you. The foundation takes 12 1m Wood Poles ( 12 wood ) and 28 2m horizontal Wood Beams ( 56 Wood ). When you used your pick on the rocks, you picked up a lot of stone. If you have a stack of 50, you can craft (from the Misc tab) a stone pile. If it\\u2019s less than 50 just craft a chest next to your workbench and put the stone there. Now we\\u2019re going to raise one section of the ground up so we can build a campfire on it because our building is raised. Make sure you have 8 stone , and select a center side area of your building and raise it twice.

\"Repair all of your gear! Make sure you have your rested buff! Put some cooked meat and berries/mushrooms in your storage just in case you die so you can eat them for your corpse run. While this guide uses a predefined seed and we know where the Crypts we need to explore are, it\\u2019s still important to go through the process of exploring because it\\u2019s a key part of the game and necessary in randomized worlds. This is a SCOUTING trip. Your goal is to scout the Black Forest areas to the North, South and West. Your goal is to find and mark Burial Crypts and Copper Deposits on your map. This scouting trip will take 3 in-game days. One day per direction. The below map shows what regions you are going to explore and in what order. When you encounter a Copper Deposit , you mark it the way you did when you ran from your starting base. When you encounter a Burial Chamber , you use the bottom map icon (the pillar with a circle). Ignore troll caves. You don\\u2019t have to write anything for Copper or Burial Chambers. An icon is all you need. The entrance to a Burial Chamber Make sure your gear is all repaired and you have at least 2 different foods active (with one of them being Cooked Meat ). Also make sure you have at least 4 cooked meat and 4 berries or mushrooms . Start Recon in the morning after you have slept and have rest bonus . We don\\u2019t go southwest because there is swamp there, and it\\u2019s far too dangerous. If you see big swampy trees unlike anything in the Black Forest, stay away. NORTH RECON (REGION 1) : head west per the above map. You will run through an abandoned town with nasty undead Draugr. Ignore those. Keep going west until you hit the Black Forest . Activate Eikthyr if available. Keep going. Once the west shore is in sight, turn north and make a full circle moving from the outside into the middle. Remember to keep your weapon/shield/bow sheathed for faster movement speed. Your goal is recon, not fighting.

\"Your goal is recon, not fighting. Avoid all fights. Skeletons almost always guard the entrance to Burial Chambers , so if you come under attack, kill them (Melee is best with axe/shield for now), find the entrance and mark it. Hugin will also appear the first time you find a Chamber. Once marked, keep going! Gather any thistle, mushrooms or blueberries you come across. AVOID FIGHTING, INCLUDING TROLLS . You\\u2019re here to do recon, not fight. You\\u2019ll kill the big blue bastards later! Once North Recon is complete, you should have come across at least 4 Burial Chambers. Get back to camp before nightfall. SOUTH RECON (REGION 3) : Once again, make sure you are full of food, and have at least 4 meat and 4 of something else. Repair any equipment and make sure you have the full rest bonus . Head south down the shoreline, but stay inland a little so you can see the shore in the distance and get the edges revealed on the very edge of the map. You will end up making a U shape as the shoreline comes back around. When this happens, follow the same circular pattern we did while doing Recon north. You\\u2019ll see the Trader on your map. Use him as the marker for heading back north to move your exploration circle inward. Don\\u2019t interact with the Trader yet; keep your reon going since we have limited sunlight. Mark all Copper and Burial Chambers on your map accordingly. Ignore troll caves. Stay away from the Swamp and Mountain biome. The enemies in those areas will 1-shot kill you. WEST RECON (REGION 2) : Once again, make sure you\\u2019re rested, equipment is repaired and you have food. Head directly south until you see the mountains. Do not get close to the Mountain Biome; if you aggro a Wolf, you will be 1-shot . Hug the west side of the Mountain Biome until you are heading south and can see the swamp, then head west and north, hugging the swamp. Like the Mountain biome, avoid the swamp at all costs . The swamp will turn to the west as you come across a big ravine.

Phase III \\u2013 Running Burial Chambers (30 Surtling Cores) Before we can properly Mine Copper and Tin to smelt Bronze, we need to build 2x Charcoal Kilns and 2x Smelters . This requires 20 Surtling Cores , which can (at this time) only be acquired in Burial Chambers . Because this is a static seed map, I can direct you to exactly which chambers to run to obtain the cores you need. If you have trouble seeing in the Burial Chambers, you can adjust the digital brightness for your gaming monitor. To do this with an Nvidia card: Go to the Nvidia Control Panel > Display > Adjust Desktop Color Settings > Select the monitor you play on > Set Brightness to 75% . Don\\u2019t forget to check your Beehive for honey ! Throw it in storage for now; do not eat it! Make sure you check every 2 in-game days. Kill any Greydwarves you come across so you can get their Greydwarf Eyes . Don\\u2019t go in the Burial Chambers at night ; it will cause 1-2 star skeletons to spawn more often! Get your Rest Bonus . Make sure to Sleep if it\\u2019s afternoon or later. Eat Food . We\\u2019re going to be fighting! We are also going to prepare for Trolls , which you will probably encounter. The good news is we are going to kill them. If you don\\u2019t have them already, gather the resources to craft 100 Fire Arrows ( 40 wood, 40 resin, 10 feathers ). Clear your inventory. Build more storage Chests if necessary. Your character should only be carrying your hotbar items, the armor you\\u2019re wearing, fire arrows and food. Everything else should be in storage.

The Chambers generally have 3 branches; left, right, and forward. You\\u2019ll want to explore all 3 in full. Immediately destroy evil bone piles ; they spawn skeletons! Note if you shoot bone piles from afar, they won\\u2019t spawn and you can kill them from a distance. Surtling Cores are glowing red cubes. Grab every single one you can! This will unlock Smelter and Charcoal Kiln . Those juicy Surtling Cores! Gather all of the yellow mushrooms you find! Careful of Rancid Remains (the green skeletons)! They poison! Grab all the precious stones and coins you see. Open and loot all chests as well. These coins and precious stones are used to buy items from the Trader! Save them in storage! When you come across a glowing red rune called \\u201cVegvisir The Elder\\u201d select it. This will reveal the location of the Elder (which you already saw doing Recon to the south). Here is the core count for each chamber: Chamber 1 = 6, Chamber 2 = 4, Chamber 3 = 5, Chamber 4 = 4, Chamber 5 = 11. Total run = 30 . Careful of ghosts ! They can be tough because you can\\u2019t see their attack to parry it; you have to listen for it. And they can hit hard. If you want to fight Trolls , you just kite and kill them with Fire Arrows. It takes between 15-20 to kill a troll. Just fire, run (without sprint) and use your sprint when he swings. As he recovers from his swing, fire again, run, rinse and repeat. Congratulations! You should now have 30 Surtling Cores !

\"We\\u2019re now ready to lay the foundation for our upcoming empire! Phase IV \\u2013 Setting up a Mining Base, Portals, Smelting and Bronze In this section we are going to set up our mining base camp for Copper, unlock Bronze weapons and Portals , and start the Smelting process! As I mentioned previously, we skip farming and crafting Troll Armor . The only advantage it provides is for builds that specialize in Sneak. If you want to create a stealth character in the future, Troll Armor is great; but for this guide, we\\u2019re learning how to tank and spank. As such, we go straight into fully upgraded Bronze armor. Make sure you have your full rest bonus ! Don\\u2019t forget to check your Beehive and save the Honey in storage! Obtain 80 stone . Easiest way is to run around and use your pickaxe on rocks . Clear the area on the south side of your base (as seen below). Build 2nd workbench outside of the south side of your base. You don\\u2019t need to cover it since we\\u2019re only using it for building objects. Build 2 Charcoal Kilns ( 40 Stone, 10 Cores ) Build 2 Smelters ( 40 Stone, 10 Cores ). Circle Hole takes Coal . Square hole takes ore . Be careful not to place them Smelters too close together, as it may prevent you from interacting with the material intake and outflow slots. Build a storage chest outside next to stairs. ( 10 wood ) I recommend the layout seen below. Collect 50 wood and fill each Kiln so when you return there\\u2019s plenty of Coal . TIME TO MINE TIN ! Make sure you have food , rest bonus and your pickaxe is repaired ! Empty your Inventory of everything except your hotbar items, armor, and food! Run up the coast (North) per the below map and start mining Tin Deposits as you find them, heading north along the Black Forest coastline. Tin Deposits only spawn on the coastline of the Black Forest or Plains . You should be able to hold 30-32 tin in your inventory.

When you\\u2019re full bring up your map and put a white dot mark called \\u201cEND TIN\\u201d. The reason we\\u2019re doing this is because we need to come back when we run out. Run back to base. Put 20 of the Tin Ore in the Smelters (10 in each, the square side). Put the rest of the ore in the storage box. Grab all of the Coal and start loading the other side of the smelters, and they should come to life! While they\\u2019re running, we\\u2019re going to go and get our first load of copper, but first\\u2026 TIME TO SET UP OUR COPPER MINING BASE! Start with a new day ( sleep ) and get that rest bonus ! Run to the point defined below. When you arrive, clear the ground and any trees or rocks in the way and set up a covered workbench and storage chest. This is going to be our main mining base for Bronze. Look at all of those juicy nodes nearby. Put any core wood, stone, wood, or anything else you want to save for later into the chest. Bring up your map and place a white circle icon at your new base location and call it MINING CAMP . When you harvest Pine for the first time, you\\u2019ll get Core Wood. This unlocks the core building pole s, Stagbreaker , and Sharp Stake s. The Stagbreaker is a ton of fun, but I don\\u2019t really use it because a shield is so important. You can play with it at end-game, but I recommend sticking to a mace and shield while progressing through the biomes since it teaches better combat skills and raises those skills for end-game. The first thing you want to do is dig around the parameter of the copper vein . You\\u2019ll find it\\u2019s much larger than it looks. This way you know where the edges are and don\\u2019t lose out on what might be hidden underground. The Parameter dug around a Copper mound. Run back and repair your Stag Pickaxe at the workbench as necessary. Mining without rest bonus sucks; don\\u2019t worry, this should be the last time you have to mine without once since we\\u2019re going to set up portals!

need to mine at least 25 copper ore . This number is important; make sure you have at least 25. You might have to make two trips if nightfall comes before you have 24. When you finally have 25 return to your base! When you arrive, there should be 20 tin bars waiting for you. You\\u2019re now entering the Kiln and Smelter management process . You need to keep the Kilns going to produce coal which you must fill the Smelters with while also keeping the Smelters full of ore. That\\u2019s why we made two of each. Go out and farm 50 more wood and load those kilns up. Also throw your copper ore in the smelter (5 in each). Once the kilns pop out 5 coal each, move the coal to each smelter and wait for the copper bars to come out. When the first Copper Bar comes out, a new option to craft a Forge appears. Metal bars and ore are very heavy, which is why we created the storage chest near the smelters to store ore and bars in. Build your Forge ( 4 stone, 4 coal, 10 wood, 6 coppe r). Crafting one Bronze Bar requires 2 Copper Bars and 1 Tin bar , so it\\u2019s a 2:1 ratio of Copper to Tin. Once you\\u2019ve smelted all of your copper ore and have at least half of the tin bars, pick them up. Go to the forge and craft at least 8 Bronze bars . If you have weight issues and can\\u2019t make it up the steps, just access your storage chest from the top of the steps! Time to craft a Bronze Axe ( 4 Wood, 8 Bronze, 2 Leather Scraps ) Replace your Flint Axe with the Bronze Axe (I put the flint axe in a storage container in case I need it for a death run) Time to harvest Fine Wood ! You can now cut down those \\u201ctoo hard\\u201d white Birch Trees . There are many around your base. This unlocks numerous new craftable items including a Fermenter , Furniture , and the Ward ; but most importantly (and what we\\u2019re going to set up now) \\u2014 a Portal .

\"Next, we need to harvest 40 Fine Wood to set up our two portals. Time to build our first Portal! You need 20 Fine Wood, 10 Greydwarf Eyes, and 2 Surtling Cores for each portal. I clear a space up behind the Kiln in the direction of the mine and place it there. Note you will go in and come out of the portal on the side the Runes are facing, so I recommend facing the runes towards your base. When the portal is built, select it and give it the tag of MINECAMP1 . All upper case (portal tags are case sensitive!) Make sure you have no Bars or Ore on you for the next step! If you do, put them in a storage chest! After building your first portal, make sure you have 20 Fine Wood, 10 Greydwarf Eyes and 2 Surtling cores on you because we\\u2019re going to run back to our Mining Camp and build the other end of this portal! Run to your Mining camp and build the other portal. Set the tag to MINECAMP1 and it should activate! Walk through the portal, and Voila! Now, for those who don\\u2019t know, you cannot transport Ore or Bars through a portal . This is by design so players are required to use other transportation methods (Ship, Cart, etc.). But why did we set up portals when we can\\u2019t transport ore through them? So we can quickly and easily repair our bronze gear (which requires a Forge, not a Workbench). Plus it allows us to work late and leave the area as soon as dark falls without having to run back, and reinstate our rest bonus by simply walking through the teleporter. It increases our efficiency tenfold. Phase V \\u2013 Rest Bonus, Road, Cart, Mining, and Bronze Items Now that we have our base set up, it\\u2019s time to get to work. The 30 Tin we farmed will allow us to smelt 30 bronze, but we\\u2019ll need 60 copper to make 30 bronze (2:1 Copper to Tin Ratio to make Bronze).

have a lot of work to do, including getting more Tin. First, a note about the Ward , which is unlocked with Fine Wood . The Ward is a unique item you can craft in your base that not only notifies you if any part of your base is under attack, but it also prevents other players from unlocking your doors, building within the radius of your Ward (which is quite large), or looting your chests. Playing solo, most people don\\u2019t need wards (unless you want to know if somebody is beating on one of your walls), but for multiplayer, even with friends, Wards are a must-have. This guide doesn\\u2019t include building a Ward, but you are welcome to do so anytime . Make sure your gear is repaired and you have ample food and rest bonus . Sleep if it\\u2019s late afternoon or later. Don\\u2019t forget to check your Beehive and save the Honey in storage! The first thing we\\u2019re going to do is improve our rest bonus . Right now we\\u2019re at 4 comfort and 11 minutes. Let\\u2019s get that up to 7. We do this with the Furniture that was unlocked. We\\u2019re going to use that. First, it\\u2019s important to note some items cancel themselves out. For example, a Chair, Stool, and bench all share the same comfort \\u201ccategory\\u201d. So do the banners. So we only need one of each shared category. First, place a Table up against the wall ( 6 Fine Wood ). This gives +1. Next, place a Chair next to the table ( 4 Fine Wood ). This gives +2. Place a Deer Rug near the fire ( 4 Deer Hide ). This gives +1. Now hang a Blue Banner anywhere you\\u2019d like in the building ( 6 Leather Scraps, 2 Fine Wood, 4 Blueberries ). This gives +1. There we go! We\\u2019re now at 9 Comfort and have a time of 16 minutes rest bonus . We just got an extra 5 minutes of bonus. That makes a huge difference when mining! Build new storage chests whenever you need more room!

should have at least 1 extra bronze bar , or be able to make one more bronze bar. Do this, and then craft 20 bronze nails . This will unlock the Cart , the Karve (ship), and a few other items. Before we take the portal, go to your upgraded workbench and upgrade your Hoe to +3 ( 3 wood, 3 stone ). Feel free to upgrade your Hammer to +3 as well if you would like. Keep the Bronze Nails on you and take the portal to your mining camp. Now we\\u2019re going to craft a Cart ( 20 wood, 10 bronze nails ). It\\u2019s under the Misc tab. We\\u2019re going to make a ROAD that goes from the mining camp to your base. We are going to use the Hoe and its \\u201cleveling\\u201d feature to do this. The fastest route back to our base is to the southeast towards the ocean, but there\\u2019s a steep cliff between the mining base location and the camp. This is OK because we\\u2019ll be dragging a full cart DOWN the cliff, and not up. This is where we learn to path! Even though the Hoe has a Pathen feature (which works great), that doesn\\u2019t adjust the terrain at all, and we want to flatten the terrain as we make the path. So make sure your trusty Hoe is repaired , head southwest and start making a path to your base! Below are a few images showing the path I chose. With normal use, the Hoe will try to raise the ground to the level your feet are currently at. To get around this on steep slopes (so we don\\u2019t try to raise the ground too high), we hold down SHIFT for the hoe to level at the position of the cursor. This makes it a ton easier to level a pathway down a steep slope! Make sure you clear out all trees, stumps and rock . The path needs to be as smooth and wide as possible to ensure the cart rolls smoothly. Once you have completed your path and are at your base, it\\u2019s time to mine more Copper so we can make a Bronze Pickaxe ( 3 Core Wood, 10 Bronze ).

\"We\\u2019re doing this right quick so we can start using the Bronze Pickaxe, which will let us mine faster than the current Antler Pickaxe. Also make sure you have at least 3 Core Wood on you (from Pine Trees around your mining camp). Always remember to stack your stone by your mining site \\u2013 you\\u2019ll be coming back to get it later on! Don\\u2019t forget you can return to your base through the portal to reactivate your rest bonus. Always do this when you can, especially while mining! Go back to base and smelt the Copper Ore and when it\\u2019s all ready, make 10 Bronze then build your Bronze Pickaxe ! You can toss the old pick. We won\\u2019t be using it again. The next thing to do is upgrade our nice new pick to +3 so we can mine as efficiently as possible. Go through the portal and mine 14 more Copper . Run back to base. Smelt the Copper. You can built it outside on the other side of the wall. Build Anvils ( 5 Wood, 2 Bronze ). I build it on the other side of the wall from the Forge since our little house is getting small. Note I put extended floors out but don\\u2019t cover with a roof. Crafting improvements don\\u2019t need to be sheltered. Next upgrade your Bronze Pickaxe to +2 ( 1 Core Wood, 5 Bronze ). This increases damage and durability. Next we\\u2019re going to upgrade our pickaxe to +3 , but that requires a Forge Cooler . So we\\u2019ll need 25 Fine Wood, and 10 Copper for the Forge Cooler, but also 10 Bronze for upgrading the Pickaxe to +3. We should only have around 5 Tin Bars left, so this will also use up our Tin. Portal back to your Mine site and mine 30 Copper Ore . Don\\u2019t worry about the weight, because we\\u2019re going to use the Cart for the first time! As you\\u2019re mining, when you get 15 ore, just run it to the cart and throw it in. That\\u2019s also a good time to port back to base and repair your pickaxe.

Time to get a bit more Tin, because we\\u2019re running low. Remember when we marked the map where we left off? It\\u2019s just north of our mine site. Run to that location and keep going up the coast, gathering as much Tin as you can until your inventory is full.

Time to run this handy cart back to our main base on the road we made. Pull the cart up right between the Smelter and chest and unload the ore into the chest and unload the stone and wood, and place that behind the smelters as stacks. Now smelt all of the copper. Don\\u2019t make Bronze out of it yet. While the smelting is going, destroy the cart with your axe ! Do it! Just don\\u2019t hit any nearby objects. Pick up the Bronze Nails . Now we don\\u2019t have to drag the cart back. All we do is rebuilt it on the other side of the portal! When the smelting is ready, build a Forge Cooler ( 25 Fine Wood, 10 Copper ). You can build it outside on the other side of the wall next to the Anvil. Congratulations! Your forge is now +3. Now smelt the copper and tin to make 10 Bronze bars . Time to upgrade our Bronze Pickaxe to +3 with 10 Core Wood and 10 Bronze Bars ! Remember our Antler Pickaxe? Its damage was 18. Your +3 Bronze Pickaxe now does 35. Not only are you mining faster, you also have twice the durability.

are also going to upgrade our Workbench. In the end, we need 115 Bronze, 6 Deer Hide, 8 Leather Scraps and 12 Wood . This means we need 230 Copper Ore and 115 Tin Ore . I personally recommend mining 250 copper ore and 125 tin so you have some extra. Once you go through the portal to your Mining Camp, rebuild the Cart. Bronze Armor is DONE and our Armor rating is 36. Swap items to update Hotkeys. Bronze Mace #2, Bronze Shield #3 and Bronze Axe #7. For the next part, we will need 3 Bronze Bar, 50 Fine Wood, 40 Core Wood and 14 Deer Hide . First, let\\u2019s improve our Workbench to Level 4. Build an Adze ( 10 Fine Wood, 3 Bronze ) near it. Now we\\u2019re going to craft and fully upgrade a shiny new Finewood Bow . Just wait until you shoot this beauty. Replace the Crude Bow in Slot #1 with the new Finewood Bow . Toss all of the old items : Wooden Shield. Crude Bow. Leather armor. Get rid of all of it. I like to throw it in the ocean a bit of a distance from my base. Take the 5 remaining Bronze Bars and craft 100 Bronzehead arrows . And there we go! You are MAXED OUT with the best weapons and armor available within the Tier 2 Biome! Try your new mace out! Note it has a devastating middle-mouse button attack! Let\\u2019s have a quick chat about Weapons. One may wonder \\u201cwhy make a Bronze Mace instead of a Sword?\\u201d The reason is at this time, Clubs (Maces) are currently the best weapons in the game, especially for end-game. You can go with swords, but you won\\u2019t be able to melee the Tier 3 Boss. Clubs also do more damage to skeletons, wolves and other end-game mobs. While the Silver Sword is very nice, and a great option for the current final boss, Clubs just outperform everything else as a 1H weapon with a shield currently.

\"Phase VI \\u2013 Getting Ancient Seeds and Killing The Elder Before we can venture to the next Biome, we have to killed the Boss and get the key he drops to open the Swamp Crypts. Killing the Elder is very easy at our current state because we have the best armor and ranged weapon available. But first, we need to get 3 Ancient Seeds . Remember those purple Greydwarf spawn areas in the Black Forest ? We need to take down 3 of those. Don\\u2019t forget to check your Beehive and save the Honey in storage! Make sure you are rested and have 3 different foods active. If it\\u2019s afternoon or later, sleep . Craft enough Fire Arrows to have a stack of at least 80. Don\\u2019t select them yet; keep the Bronze Arrows selected. Locate the Elder spawn position on the map to the south of you. Activate the Eikthyr special ability and run there. Want to raise your new mace/club skill? Use the mace on a rock! We need to locate and destroy 3 Purple Greydwarf spawn piles around the Elder spawn area to get our Ancient Seeds . The image below shows what the spawn locations look like. Note some piles will give 2 seeds vs. 1. Destroy this terrible thing! \\u2026 and get an Ancient Seed! Once you have 3 Ancient Seeds , check the time of day. Make sure it\\u2019s not afternoon or evening, and make sure you have at least 8 minutes of Rest Bonus . If you don\\u2019t, you\\u2019ll need to run back to your base and rest. If it\\u2019s afternoon or later, or you don\\u2019t have at least 8 minutes of Rest Bonus, you\\u2019ll want to go back to your base and sleep . When you\\u2019re ready, go to the Elder Altar, load the seeds into Slot #8 and use it on the Ancient Bowl. This will summon The Elder ! Just kite him around the pillars, and use the pillars to block his ranged tangle attack. It\\u2019s a pretty easy fight. When he\\u2019s down, pick up the Elder Trophy and Swamp Key .

Just don\\u2019t engage in any combat or you won\\u2019t have the armor to protect you! When you get there, hang the head of The Elder. Do not activate his power . Near the stones, clear a spot and build a Workbench and then a Portal. Name it ALTAR . Once connected, step through it back to your base. PART III \\u2013 THE SWAMP BIOME (TIER 3) What we\\u2019ll accomplish: Exploring the Swamp, Getting tons of Iron, Making max-level Tier 3 weapons and armor, learn new food recipes and building parts. Congratulations! You\\u2019ve mastered the Bronze age! Ready for the Swamp? Poison is deadly, and the leeches paired with Draugr and their dungeon spawn piles can be a recipe for disaster. Let me preface by saying this: NEVER go into the swamp at night. This includes being in Crypts at night. Don\\u2019t do it. Just don\\u2019t. Not until later when you have a complete set of upgraded Iron Armor and gear. While we have a bit of swamp west of our base, there are only 4 Crypts in it, and it\\u2019s important that we learn how to sail and transport Iron Ore with our ship, so we\\u2019re going to head to the Swamp to the east of our base. One note I want to make is many players by this time focus on building a new base. You can do that before you head into the swamp. One reason we haven\\u2019t torn down or replaced or expanded our base was to show how efficient a small building can be. But as we progress through the game, it becomes necessary to set up a portal network and extend the crafting and storage areas quite a bit.

\"Once we discover and start using Iron, we can also raise our Comfort level quite a bit. The current goal is to get iron as soon as possible and set up a structure of iron farming and transport so we can maximize our gear and unlock some awesome weapons and armor to prepare for the next Biome: Mountains. And just wait until you encounter a pack of wolves! Phase I \\u2013 Preparing Poison Resist Potions The first thing we need to do is build another campfire next to our current one. Remove the floor piece and build the fire. Build a Cauldron ( 10 Tin ) over the new fire. This will unlock a bunch of new recipes for Mead and Food. Don\\u2019t forget to adjust the ceiling to let the smoke out! You should easily have 20 honey by now. We need to make 2 Mead Base: Poison Resistance ( 10 Honey, 5 Thistle, 1 Neck Tail, 10 Coal ). We do this at the Cauldron . Gather any additional materials necessary. Once you have two Poison Resistance Mead Bases , it\\u2019s time to build two Fermenters . You\\u2019ll need 60 Fine Wood, 10 Bronze and 20 Resin . Our little house is getting a bit tight, but we can make it work. Put the two of them side by side in the open end within the house. Once they\\u2019re built, put a Mead Base in each one. But now we need to close the open areas behind them with walls or we will get a \\u201ctoo exposed\\u201d message with them (and they won\\u2019t work). Check them to make sure they don\\u2019t say \\u201ctoo exposed\\u201d when done. Sometimes it takes a few seconds to update the message. It will take two in-game days for them to create the potions. That\\u2019s OK, we need to build a boat and make sure we have materials for two more portals! We also want to make sure we have enough storage. Build and stack additional chests as necessary. I generally create 10 storage chests, two stacked on each other, all side by side, and use them according to what Biome the items dropped in.

Phase II \\u2013 Swamp Preparation While we wait for our potions to get ready, it\\u2019s time to gather the resources for building two portals and our Karve boat. I want to mention the technique of Tacking , which is used when you have to sail against the wind. Here\\u2019s a link to a Valheim Simple Sailing Tacking Guide that\\u2019s very helpful. For those who are new to the game, here\\u2019s a video that overviews how to sail in the game. The first thing we\\u2019re going to do is build our ship. You can also build a small dock if you would like, using horizontal beams to anchor in the water and hold up the floor boards. You need 4 Bronze Bars, 30 Fine Wood, 10 Deer Hide, and 20 Resin . Once you have the Bars, craft 80 nails . You don\\u2019t need to build a dock, but it can be fun to do. When you\\u2019re ready, build the Karve ( 30 Fine Wood, 10 Deer Hide, 20 Resin, 80 Bronze Nails = 4 Bronze Bars ). Next, we need the materials for 2 portals. Half of them you\\u2019ll take with you. Gather 40 Fine Wood, 20 Greydwarf Eyes and 4 Surtling Cores . Once you have these materials, build a 3rd Portal at your base and tag it SWAMP1 . Make sure you have the materials on your character to be able to build a Workbench and another Portal. Once the fermenting is done, you will have 12 Poison Resistance Potions . Keep 10 and put 2 in storage. Make sure you have the Swamp Key on your character! Phase III \\u2013 Sailing to the Swamp and Building the Portal The swamp we\\u2019re going to is in the first island to the east of our base, and it has 20 Sunken Crypts.

Make sure you have at least 80 Bronze Arrows . Make sure your items are all repaired . Make sure you are rested with full rest bonus . Make sure you have the Swamp Key in your inventory. Make sure it\\u2019s MORNING . It\\u2019s Sailing Time! Hop in your Karve and head due east. Try to stay exactly east. When you come to the shore, you should head a little south to the point shown on the map below. You want to build your base in the Meadows on the edge of the Swamp. Note that some creatures from the Swamp will probably come your way as soon as you land. You can ignore leeches since they stay in the water, but if you see Slimes jumping your way, shoot them with your bow and bronze arrows and don\\u2019t let them get close to you. Draugr can easily be fought with your mace and shield. Clear a spot with your Hoe , build a Workbench and your Portal . Set the tag to SWAMP1 and it should connect. Now build a storage chest next to the portal. Open your map and place a house icon and call it SWAMP1 . Your Swamp base is now ready! Note we don\\u2019t need to build any defenses as I\\u2019ve never had my swamp portal destroyed when it\\u2019s on the edge like this. Now you can kill any leeches that have gathered in the water. Note if you shoot them once or twice they will swim away. Do not follow them. Wait until they come back. Kill them and collect their Bloodbags . Kill Draugr get their Intestines to unlock Sausage , one of the staple foods until end-game. Kill any slimes and get their slime bags. Time to head into the swamp and look for Sunken Crypts ! Use a Poison Resistance Potion .

a Poison Resistance Potion . It lasts 10 minutes. With this potion you can melee slimes and leeches! Without it you must range attack them and not let them get close or their poison will kill you. NEVER go into the water if you can help it. Leeches will bite you and it\\u2019s easy to get bogged down while a group of Skeletons or Draugr shoot you with arrows. We use our Hoe to level the ground as we traverse the swamp, making paths and raising the ground. As you traverse the swamp, make note of any trees that have big green blobs growing on them . Mark these on your map with a white dot that says \\u201cG\\u201d. We\\u2019ll come back to those later. Make sure you mark these trees; we\\u2019ll be coming back to them later! When you come across your first Sunken Crypt , mark it on your map like we did the Burial Chambers in the black forest; a single icon. We\\u2019re going straight in! Use the Swamp Key and you\\u2019re in! Sunken Crypts are larger than Burial Chambers, and have these piles of goo you must hack through with your pickaxe in order to farm Iron and get to the next chambers. These are our glorious sources of Iron Scrap! Make sure your anti-poison potion is UP at all times while you\\u2019re in the swamp! Depending on the chamber layout, I always go through the open areas first. Keep your eye open for chests and treasure (pick up all coins, amber, pearls, etc.). Also pick up every Iron Chain you see in any chest. The most dangerous thing in these crypts are the Body Piles that spawn Draugr . It\\u2019s very easy to be quickly overrun. You can usually hear the buzzing flies before you can see them. When there\\u2019s a body pile, you must destroy it as soon as possible. You can build a campfire in the crypt to quickly dry out and remove the wet debuff! Remember, the Draugr and Slimes can only make it through a corridor that\\u2019s completely opened; one technique is to hack through to the other side but leave enough of the muck so they can\\u2019t make it through.

\"This makes it very easy to pick them off with arrows. Hack through all of the slime and load up on Iron Scrap ! The first chest will probably cause you to get to max weight. When you get to max weight, run back to your camp, put the ore in the Storage Chest and portal back to your Main base to deposit the other Tier 3 goodies like Intestines, etc. Don\\u2019t forget to go back to your base to get your rest bonus and repair your gear! Remember to use your Eikthyr power when running back and forth! Grab all the yellow mushrooms you come across. When you loot a Chain for the first time, it will unlock Forge Bellows . PIck up every Iron Chain you com across (in chests) . It\\u2019s very important for upgrading your Forge and crafting the end-game shield. Make sure you pick up all of the rubies, gold, and other treasure spread throughout the chambers. Don\\u2019t worry about picking up Ancient Bark. It\\u2019s very easy to get, very heavy, and you need your space free for Iron Scrap. Drop it and ignore it for now. The first chamber alone will have you making 4-5 runs back and forth to your camp to put Iron Scrap in the chest. Don\\u2019t forget to portal to your base to refresh your rest bonus when you do run back to your camp. It makes all the difference. The first crypt (closest to our base) gives roughly 70 iron scrap . This is a lot more than average. Your Karve can hold 4 stacks of 30 (for a total of 120). When your character\\u2019s current weight limit (300) and all essential items, you can hold 22-24 scraps, allowing you to transport a maximum of 142-144 per trip on a Karve . Right now we only have around 70; we\\u2019re going to make our return trip because we want to be able to mine Iron Scrap quicker and more efficiently, so we\\u2019re going to run back to base and make a shiny new upgraded Iron Pickaxe. Before we sail back, I do recommend building a dock for your ship since we\\u2019ll be coming here many times, and because it\\u2019s easier to haul the ore to your ship when it\\u2019s properly next to a dock when you\\u2019re encumbered.\", \"mimetype\": \"text/plain\", \"start_char_idx\": 72110, \"end_char_idx\": 74120, \"metadata_seperator\": \"\\n\", \"text_template\": \"{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}\", \"class_name\": \"TextNode\"}"}'),

\"Position your boat at the end of your dock so you can easily open the hold from the dock. Make sure you have plenty of food so you have high stamina . Go to your storage container and grab all the scrap. This should put your weight over 800. While encumbered, walk down the dock to your ship and put the scrap in the hold. Now jump in the ship and sail back home ! Once you dock at home, you\\u2019ll do the same thing; however this time you might lose stamina before you get to your storage box by the smelters. Not a problem; just toss the ore on the ground until you regain your stamina, and pick it back up. Put the ore in your storage box by your Kilns and we\\u2019re ready to smelt! Phase IV \\u2013 Iron Scrap, More Comfort, Sausage, Trader, Carry Weight Time to smelt our near 70 scrap! You know what to do. While it\\u2019s cooking, go out and farm wood to keep the kilns going and the coal coming in. When you pick up your first Iron Bar , a ton of items will appear. Welcome to the next tier of weapons, armor, and more! The Stonecutter is also unlocked, which is how we make stone walls and floors. We can now also create Iron Reinforced beams for the strongest building structure support available in the game. The Reinforced Chest was also unlocked; the best storage chest in the game with 16 slots. This is one reason we rushed to Iron before upgrading our base. Check your honey ! Start smelting the Iron. We\\u2019re going to Smelt all of it, so grab the wood, feed the Kilns and keep things going. Put the bars in the Storage as they become available. Take 1 bar and craft 20 Iron Nails . This unlocks the Raven Throne and Longship . Get 20 Fine Wood , and craft a Raven Throne ( 10 Iron Nails, 20 Fine Wood ) in your house. This will raise your Comfort to 12 (19 minutes) . You should have some Bronze left over from your previous runs.

next you\\u2019re going to craft a Hanging Brazier ( 5 Bronze, 2 Coal 1 Chain ) and place it on the ceiling of your house. This will raise the Comfort level to 13 (20 Minutes) . Next, craft the Iron Pickaxe and upgrade it to +2 ( 30 Iron, 4 Core Wood ). To upgrade the Pickaxe to +3 we need to increase the level of our Forge. To do this, we\\u2019re going to craft a Smith\\u2019s Anvil outside by the other upgrades ( 20 Iron, 5 Wood ). Now we can upgrade our Iron Pickaxe to +3 ( 20 Iron, 2 Core Wood ). Look at that; we\\u2019ve pretty much used all of our Iron \\u2013 that was quick! The good news we have an awesome mining tool with great durability! We did this first so we can run the crypts quicker and more efficient. I just toss the Bronze Pickaxe once I have the Iron one. The only reason you\\u2019ll want to keep it is if you plan on giving it to a friend. If not, toss it and replace slot #6 with your new handy +3 Iron Pickaxe (which does 43 damage vs the old 35 and has more durability). Time to make Sausage ! Go to your cauldron with Raw Meat + Entrails + Thistle . Sausage is the most used food in the game . It\\u2019s awesome. Make as much as you can. I recommend having 10 on your character at all times. If you need more, make additional Poison Resistance potions. I find once I really get a feeling of how the Swamp works, I don\\u2019t need the potion at all because I\\u2019ve got great food and know what monsters to stay away from. But do whatever you\\u2019re comfortable with. It\\u2019s this time in the game I recommend players look for the Trader. We\\u2019re lucky to be running a predefined map where we know exactly where he\\u2019s located; but for those playing a world they know nothing about, finding the Trader can be very tedious because the player has to sail around the world. This can be very dangerous.

Gather 4 Surtling Cores, 40 Fine Wood, and 20 Greydwarf Eyes . Clear a spot and build out 4th portal at the base and call it TRADER . Grab all of your treasure! This includes Coins, Amber, Rubies, and Pearls . Make sure you have the materials on you to build the portal at the other end, and run to the trader! Don\\u2019t forget to use Eikthyr\\u2019s special power. We\\u2019re heading for the bag icon on our map to the south. STAY AWAY FROM THE MOUNTAIN BIOME. Wolves will still kill you quickly . When you\\u2019re just outside the Trader bubble, clear a spot, put down a Workbench and build the other end of the portal. Label it TRADER . Talk to Haldor. First start clicking on the hanging coin icon to the lower right of the UI. This will sell all of your treasure (Amber, etc). You should have enough to buy Megingjord Belt . If not (and you\\u2019re close) just run another Burial Chamber in the Black Forest until you have enough. Once you buy the belt, equip it. You now have 450 Carry Weight. Now we\\u2019re a really capable Iron Scrap farmer! Don\\u2019t worry about buying anything else at this time. Head back to your base! Now might be a great time to take a break and expand your camp! It\\u2019s up to you! Our little house is pretty packed, but it\\u2019ll work all the way through Mountains if we want to. Phase V \\u2013 Farming 500 Iron in The Swamp Are you ready for the longest farming requirement currently in the game? We need 500 Iron Scrap . By the time you\\u2019re done, you\\u2019ll hate the swamps. Don\\u2019t worry though; it\\u2019ll be worth it. ~8 hours depending on your speed, combat luck, and other factors.

\"Check your Honey ! The good news is everything we need is in this swamp instance; there are enough crypts to easily get us to 500 Iron. I like to use a Karve to do this because it adds variation and a break to things. Some players build a Longboat so they can haul everything in one run, but it\\u2019s all up to you as to how you want to do it. The Swamp is so close to our base, going back and forth with 150 Iron Scrap works just fine, and only takes 4 trips. Here\\u2019s what you\\u2019re going to craft (in order): Toolrack (to raise your forge one level), +4 Iron Pickaxe (do this with the ore from your first run). After that, build: Iron scale mail, Iron Greaves, Iron Helmet, Banded Shield, Iron Mace, Iron Axe , and Huntsman Bow . Your Iron Armor just at +1 is better than your Bronze Armor, so you can craft them all first, then upgrade them as you complete additional runs. We\\u2019re also going to build a Bellows at the very end (last run), which requires 4 Chain (which we get running the Crypts). The Chain is very rare, and found either in chests in the Crypts, or when you kill a Wraith (spirits in the swamp that come out only at night). You can craft a Style on your banded shield! When you encounter a glowing red rune in a Crypt, be sure to select it; this will put the location of Bonemass on your map! You only need to collect 10 Withered Bones. After that you can discard them, but make sure you have 10 in storage back at your base! Kill Surtlings when you can; having extra Surtling Cores to make Portals is always a big plus. And we\\u2019ll be making another portal shortly. Following this approach, we will have all Iron +4 gear and have a total of 60 armor. This is a huge difference from our Bronze Armor. As you are doing this, make sure you keep your food up; make Sausage , gather Yellow Mushrooms , have Cooked Meat , and check your Honey regularly. Make more Poison Resistance potions if you need.

It operates like a Workbench for stone building structures for base upgrades. It also unlocks the Hearth , which gives us an additional Comfort point . Note the Hearth must be placed on ground or stone foundation. Congratulations! You just finished the most tedious farming in the game! Time to move to the next Biome!

PART IV \\u2013 THE MOUNTAIN BIOME (TIER 4) Time to head into the mountains! With 60 armor, we should have no problem with Wolves, and a +4 Huntsman Bow with Ironhead Arrows will easily drop Drakes . Plus we\\u2019ll get access to Obsidian Arrows very quickly. Our initial goal is to farm Frost Glands from the Drakes so we can make Frost Arrows to go and kill Bonemass, the Tier 3 Boss. But if you plan on Tank\\u2019n\\u2019Spank for Bonemass, we\\u2019re still going into the mountains to get Wolf Pelt and a few other items to improve our base and fighting capabilities.

\"While we\\u2019re well equipped for the Mountain Biome, Wolves are very nasty. First, build another portal at your base. Tag it MOUNTAIN1 . Also make sure you have the resources needed to build the portal on the other end with you. Run south to the nearby Mountain biome. As soon as you enter, use one of your Frost Resistance potions. Wolves are very dangerous, and even though we have great armor and weapons, if you are attacked by 2-3 wolves and one or more is a 1-star, you can quickly find yourself in trouble. Wolves can attack two times in the amount of time it takes you to swing once. Try to block parry and stagger them when you can, but it can be challenging with 2 or more. Just do your best to learn the cadence of killing wolves. You can also shoot them from a distance; but you need to kill them because we need their pelts! Kill wolves to get Wolf Pelts and Wolf Fangs . Unlock the Dragon Bed and Wolf Rug . Do not fight Wolves on slopes; get to flat ground . Kite them if you have to. It\\u2019s VERY important to manage your stamina in the mountains since you have to use a lot to traverse the mountainsides. When you see Obsidian Deposits , mine them. You might see Silver veins sticking out; if you do, mark them on the map. Now there aren\\u2019t any drakes on this first mountain; it\\u2019s not high enough. But we get to kill some wolves and mine Obsidian . Head south to the next Mountain. This next mountain has a lot of Drakes . Grab their Freeze Glands and pick up any Drake Trophies that drop. Do not pick up Dragon Eggs but mark them on your map with a white dot and \\u201cEgg\\u201d. Build your portal at a high point between the two parts of the mountain near the Egg location shown in the map below . Set the tag to MOUNTAIN1 to connect it. This position is very important because it\\u2019s very close to two Silver nodes we\\u2019ll mine later. Also build a storage chest for your Wolf Pelts and Wolf Fangs . There is a small patch of Plains biome on the south side of the southern Mountain range.

Phase II \\u2013 Killing Bonemass Time to kill Bonemass ! It\\u2019s a bit of journey to get to him, and we\\u2019ll be setting up a portal just in case we die. There are two ways to fight Bonemass . You can either melee him with your Mace and Shield , or you can kite him with Frost Arrows . The fastest way is Mace and Shield, but you need to be good with your blocks and know when to kite, etc. We have the resources to do him either way, so choose whatever method you\\u2019re the most comfortable with. Craft a new portal at your base (or rename an existing one). Name it BONEMASS . If you plan on kiting him, craft 120 Frost Arrows . Even if you plan on Facetanking him, I still recommend making at least 60 as it\\u2019s always good to have the ability to shoot him from a distance if necessary. You do have the ability to craft a Healing Potion , and if you are playing Hardcore , I recommend start using them now. But if you aren\\u2019t playing hardcore, healing potions are optional at this point since being decked out in fully upgraded Iron armor makes us pretty tough for the current content. Make sure you have at least 5 Sausage, Grilled Neck Tail and Cooked Meat . Make sure you have our awesome new Comfort Level 15 Rest Bonus of 22 Minutes. Make sure your Karve is repaired . You have two choices . If you\\u2019re really comfortable with the game and kicking ass, you can sail to Bonemass in the morning , which will put you there at night.

If the wind dies and you have a serpent on your tail, you\\u2019ll have no choice but to try and kill it with arrows. Grab 10 withered bone . This is what you use to summon Bonemass. Make sure you have 2 Poison Resist Potions . You don\\u2019t need to eat until you get close to your destination. The Bonemass spawn is a bit dangerous because it\\u2019s surrounded by Plains. So we\\u2019re going to sail around the plains and land on the east side of the swamp. This will be our first swamp landing, so be prepared to fight! You may notice a small floating island as you\\u2019re sailing to Bonemass. That\\u2019s a Kraken . Mark it on your map for later . Stay away from the Plains . As you sail around the south end of the Plains, you\\u2019ll see Fuling base camp with bonfires. Below is a map of our landing spot. When you see the small abandoned tower house on the east side of the Swamp, you\\u2019ve arrived at your landing spot. Make sure you\\u2019ve taken an anti-poison potion and be prepared to fight; make sure your health is full! Land and secure. Build your portal. Tag it BONEMASS . Put the point on your map as well, calling it the same thing. If it\\u2019s night, go back to your base and sleep until morning. Make sure you have your full rest bonus ! Head to his spawn point. But don\\u2019t spawn him yet. Instead, take out all of the creatures around his spawn point because this fight is all about running and Kiting. Be sure to take out the Surtlings because they\\u2019ll definitely aggro you during the fight. Now we\\u2019re going to do something fun.

we\\u2019re going to do something fun. Surtlings die when they touch water ! So what we\\u2019re going to do is use our Pickaxe and lower the ground around the Surtling flame spout so it\\u2019s all water. Now when they spawn, they\\u2019ll just die and explode! This will ensure they don\\u2019t interrupt our fight with Bonemass, and it\\u2019s a fun way to get free Surtling Cores. Additional fun fact. Surtling Trophies make infinite light sources when mounted on the wall at your base ! Make sure you have Frost Arrows selected, have full food and health , and have an anti-poison potion ready to go if yours is still counting down (hotkey it). If you don\\u2019t have it active, use the anti-poison potion . Activate Eikthyr\\u2019s power to help with kiting. Doing Bonemass melee is pretty easy as long as you\\u2019re able to block his attacks and ensure you\\u2019re not mid-swing of your weapon when he attacks next. You can beat him down in under 5 minutes with your Mace if handled properly. Just run away when you need to regenerate a bit. If you Kite Bonemass, just stay away from him and kill the adds. Fire from a distance. SUMMON BONEMASS! Once he\\u2019s down make sure you pick up the Wishbone and his Trophy . Run back to the swamp portal base and DESTROY your boat with your Mace . Pick up the pieces and go through the portal to your main base. When you go back to your base, rebuild the boat at your dock and then take the portal to the Altar, and hang the Bonemass trophy! No need to activate it yet. Go back to your base and celebrate! Phase III \\u2013 Mining Silver, the Long Road Thankfully, mining Silver isn\\u2019t nearly as tedious as Iron. Not only will we get and fully upgrade our Armor and Weapons, we\\u2019ll also get the best bow in the game. All of this will require 350 silver . To find Silver, we use the Wishbone that Bonemass dropped.

\"This helps us locate veins that we can then excavate. The good news is if you\\u2019re running the Guide map, we already know where the silver is, and where it is not. Sadly, the mountain range to the north and directly to the south of our camp doesn\\u2019t have any silver because they aren\\u2019t high enough; Silver only generates above a certain elevation. The good news is the Silver Veins are right around where we placed our MOUNTAIN1 portal! Granted we can only use the portal to repair, it\\u2019s already there and ready to go. We will need to build another base camp at the foot of the mountain. Note the average Silver Vein yields between 80-90 Silver Ore . Craft 100 Obsidian Arrows . These are the best arrows until we get to the Plains. Plus you\\u2019ll 2-shot drakes with them. Equip the arrows and toss any others you have. Make sure you have at least 1 Frost Resistance Potion . Set the tag of the BONEMASS portal at your base to ROAD (we\\u2019re just re-routing it). Make sure you have another portal at your base tagged MOUNTAIN1 one and enough materials on you to build a new portal. The first thing we\\u2019re going to do is locate Silver veins. We do this by going through the MOUNTAIN1 portal and equipping our Wishbone . There are two veins right by the portal . Once the beeper is very active start digging and you\\u2019ll uncover the vein. As soon as you hit the vein the Wishbone will no longer try to detect that particular vein. Kill wolves and store their fangs and pelts in the storage chest by the Portal! We\\u2019re going to get permeant cold protection on our first run back, so you only need one potion to do this! Create a Storage Container at the portal. This is where you\\u2019re going to put all of the ore as you dig it up. Locate and start digging up the closest vein! Remember to dig around the edges so you can see how big it is and how far it stretches. Also remember to equip your strength belt so you can carry 450. Silver veins always have 3 legs. It takes about 10 minutes to mine one vein.

If you take your portal to the mountains while it\\u2019s raining, even with an anti-freeze cape, you\\u2019ll still freeze while wet! For this reason you have to wait to go through the portal until it\\u2019s not raining at your base. Sometimes the Silver veins will run through rock! Not a problem; just break the Rock away! Begin mining that delicious silver ! Toss rock or build a stone pile as you get too heavy and take the ore to the storage container near the Portal. Once your potion nears expiring (2 minutes or so left), load up as much ore as you can on your character (should be 22-24) without becoming encumbered and head down the slope directly to the north (seen in the below image). As soon as you get to the base where the land flattens out and it says Black Forest in the upper right map, clear the space, build a Workbench and Storage Chest , and put a point on your map called \\u201cSILVER BASE\\u201d. This is where we\\u2019ll be running two carts of ore down to from the top of the mountain. The storage chest is for storing one of the cartloads before we destroy the cart. Note we are not building a portal here since we\\u2019ll be using the MOUNTAIN1 portal above. Our Silver Base Location. And now for the real fun. We are going to make a road all the way back to our base . Because we\\u2019re going through the Black Forest , we\\u2019ll encounter trolls, and we have to build a bridge across a ravine ! This is going to take a few in-game days to do properly because of how much we need to remove (and the bridge will take a bit of time). This is why we carry the portal with us. When nightfall comes or we need to refresh our rest bonus, we just drop the portal down, set the tag to ROAD , go back to base, rest up, and then get back to work (taking down the portal again as we continue building the road). Let\\u2019s make that road!

\"Let\\u2019s make that road! Don\\u2019t worry, it\\u2019s very much worth it! Remember to hold down shift while leveling ground on slopes! The general rule of thumb is to move forward making the path for about 10-15 seconds, then go back and clean it up and make sure it\\u2019s smooth. You must get rid of all large rocks, trees, tree trunks, and bushes the cart could get caught up on. The best bridge we can build at the Ravine is a raised ground bridge. To do this we must farm stone from the big rocks around the ravine. I was able to build the below bridge with around 120 stone (which only took a few minutes to get). Don\\u2019t worry, one width is wide enough for the cart! Also, there\\u2019s a trick to using only one raise per block; here\\u2019s a Video Link to how to do it if you aren\\u2019t aware of the technique. Piece of Cake! And yes, a Cart will go across it just fine! \\u2026 as long as you\\u2019re running straight. Build a chest , put your ore in it, and start picking that rock! Once you have around 120 stone , go ahead and build that land bridge! Once done, continue; make sure the road that goes up the other side of the ravine is as smooth as possible or you may not be able to pull a full cart up the slope, even with stamina. As soon as you start the path on the other side of the ravine, go a little to the right so you get better sloping. We\\u2019re going around the east side of the mountain range to the north, by the trader. Stay in the Black Forest ; no need to go into the Mountain Biome. Always put your ore in a chest before you port back to base . This requires some shuffling. Throw the Fine Wood down, then farm 20 wood; make the workbench then chest, then pick up the fine wood, make the portal, put the ore in the storage unit, then go to your base to rest/repair/get food. You can stop making the path when you reach the open field south of our base if you want, but I like to complete it all the way to the base.

When you pick it up, you should see the unlocks for Wolf Armor, Wolf Cape, Silver Sword , etc. pop up. This is the next tier of armor! But more importantly, the cape will protect us from the code and ensure we no longer need potions! Craft a Wolf Fur Cape ( 6 Wolf Pelt, 4 Silver, 1 Wolf Trophy ). Don\\u2019t upgrade it; we\\u2019re just leaving it at level 1. Equip your first cape and feel the warm goodness of permanent frost resistance! No more potions! Phase IV \\u2013 Mining 350 Silver, Transporting and smelting We need 350 Silver in total to upgrade our gear completely to prepare for the Tier 4 boss and going to the hardest place in the game: The Plains. The problem is the 4 nodes around the MOUNTAIN1 portal only provide 330 ore (including the amount we brought back making our road). The good news is there\\u2019s another node on the very south side of the mountain just north of us. We\\u2019ll be stopping by that to grab the extra 20 as we\\u2019re taking our cart through the woods. Quick note \\u2013 we skip the Silver Shield; we just don\\u2019t need it. Also, do not mine at night. That\\u2019s when 2-star Wolves come out, and they can kill you . There\\u2019s also a very dangerous werewolf creature that comes out at night in the Mountains . Kill wolves and keep their pelts! Store the pelts in the chest by the portal. You\\u2019ll need them for later! Now it\\u2019s time to get all of that Silver. Make sure you\\u2019re rested , have ample food , and your equipment is repaired . Get that Hive Honey ! There\\u2019s our four nodes of Juicy Silver Goodness! Take your portal and start mining the two veins by the MOUNTAIN1 portal.

Time to get that down the mountain! Go back to your base. Refresh your Rest Bonus . This is very important. Also, if it\\u2019s not morning, sleep . We have a big day tomorrow! Make sure you have plenty of food . Get (or craft) 10 Bronze Nails and 20 wood . Take the portal back to MOUNTAIN1 . Build a cart . Load up all the ore onto the cart and go flying down the hill! It\\u2019s fun! When you get to the bottom and at your road starting point, unload the ore from the Cart into the Storage Chest . Destroy the cart with your mace, pick up the nails and wood, and head back up the mountain to the second chest . Do the same thing. Craft the cart, transport the Ore, and take that Cart flying down the mountainside! If you get stuck or have any issues just unhook the cart, manually push it, and if necessary, destroy it with your mace and rebuild it in a location you can quickly re-load the ore back onto it at. Once all of the ore is at the bottom of the hill at our Road starting point, now we need to be careful about how much weight we put into the Cart. You should be able to carry 25-27 ore on your character. You can put 90 in the Cart for a weight of 1260. Don\\u2019t go over this, or you won\\u2019t be able to sprint pull it up any steep hills. Be careful when going over your land bridge; you must be EXACTLY in the middle. You can activate Eikthyr\\u2019s power right after the bridge before you pull the cart up the steep incline out of the ravine. You can fight and clear and use your hoe while pulling a cart!

No Hitchhikers! Sleep so we can start the next run at the beginning of the day. Make sure you have Rest bonus and food .

We\\u2019re going to stop by another vein and get it on our way back. After we cross the Ravine and head up that steep hill, we park our cart at the top ( make sure it can\\u2019t roll away ), put any ore you\\u2019re carrying in the cart, and head up the hill and into the Mountain biome to the northwest towards our final Silver Vein. Once you find the vein, mine 23-25 ore. When you have it, run back down the hill to your cart, load the cart up with the 120 and put the rest on your character, and head back home!

Your armor should now be 79. Given 100 is the highest in the game currently, we\\u2019re doing very well! But now for some real weapon upgrades! Next we are going to craft one of the best melee weapons in the game, and the weapon you\\u2019ll use until you get the final end-game melee club. We will craft Frostner . You\\u2019ll need 600 coins for this . You should have enough coins from killing trolls and running dungeons; but if not, the easiest way to make coins is to run the Black Forest at night and kill 1-2 star creatures, or you can run Crypts in the Black Forest you haven\\u2019t already completed, and sell the treasure. When you have 600 coins, visit the Trader and buy 5 Ymir Flesh . This will unlock Frostner . Craft and upgrade Frostner to +4 ( 120 Silver, 5 Flesh, 5 Freeze Glands, 50 Ancient Bark ). If you need Ancient Bark, just run to the SWAMP1 portal and farm it from the trees. You now have an amazing mace that will destroy undead and does over 100 damage of 3 types.

Be very careful when you build the stairs and platforms up the tree; if you fall, you could die. Sometimes the Guck falls to the ground; it\\u2019s ok \\u2013 mine all of it while you\\u2019re up there then run down and pick it all up. Just 3 trees should give you all that you need (depending on the trees). Once you\\u2019re done, head back to your base; if you don\\u2019t have 40 Ancient Bark, quickly farm it in the Swamp. Head back to your base and craft the best bow in the game, the Draugr Fang \\u2013 and upgrade it to +4 ( 80 Silver, 40 Ancient Bark, 14 Deer Hide, 22 Guck ).

The good thing is we already have cold resistance, and on top of that, we have the best bow in the game that not only does top tier damage, but also does Poison damage. Let\\u2019s do this! It\\u2019s a long run! Craft 200 Obsidian arrows . Yes, 200. Note it\\u2019s possible to down him with far less than 200, but given skill level variations, missing him while he\\u2019s in flight and having to spend arrows on Drake or other adds that spawn, 200 is a good number you should be fine with. Load up on food . Get materials for a Portal and have them on your character. Change your temporary base portal tag to MODER . Take the ALTAR portal and begin running north to Moder\\u2019s mountain!

can unequip your chest and legs to gain 10% movement speed! Just remember to put the armor back on as you approach the mountain! Even though I ran through 3 mountain ranges, I never found the runestone to reveal Moder\\u2019s location; but we know where he is from the main static map seed. If you\\u2019re playing a different game, you\\u2019ll have to keep running Mountain biomes until you encounter his runestone (which is usually in a stone structure). When going up the mountain (using sprint), pace yourself and use large rocks embedded in the side of the slope to rest without sliding. As we run to Moder\\u2019s summoning altar, we need to collect 3 Dragon Eggs . They weight 200lbs each, so we grab them one at a time and put them at the altar. If you\\u2019re already carrying one and come across another, mark it on the map so you can come back and get it when you\\u2019ve mounted the one you\\u2019re carrying. Make your portal quite a distance from the Altar; don\\u2019t put it in the tower . Moder will just destroy it (that\\u2019s too close). He really loves to destroy your portal. I recommend putting it on the neighboring mountaintop, a good 30 second run away . Once you\\u2019ve placed all 3 eggs, don\\u2019t summon him yet. Go back to your base and restore your rest bonus . If it\\u2019s not morning, sleep . Make sure your food is loaded. Once you\\u2019re ready, go through the portal. Make sure the area around the Altar is clear of wolves and Drakes. We don\\u2019t want any trouble during the boss fight. When the area is clear, activate the Altar and summon Moder . Moder Egg Locations! His most dangerous attack is the ice shard breath from the air. You\\u2019ll learn when he\\u2019s going to do it because you\\u2019ll hear the breathe-in sound FX. Just sprint run perpendicular to his angle and you shouldn\\u2019t get hit. You can also stand still and block with your shield when he does it. If you\\u2019re at full health with 3 food, you should be fine. It\\u2019s a long and drawn out fight, even with the best damage and bow against him.
